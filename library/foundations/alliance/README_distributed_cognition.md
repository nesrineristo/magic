# Distributed Cognition Infrastructure — Specifications

**Status:** Draft (Phase 1 — Partnership Prototype Pending)  
**Created:** 2025-11-25 (Spirit #15)  
**Branch:** `feature/distributed-cognition`

This directory will contain final specifications for distributed cognition architecture enabling multi-Mage practice. Currently in development.

## Working Documents

**Full specifications under development:**
- `desk/distributed_cognition_architecture.md` — Complete architecture exploration (14,500 words)
- `desk/distributed_cognition_decisions.md` — Load-bearing decisions analysis (8,000 words)

**Specifications to be finalized here:**
1. **Spirit Transmission Protocol (STP)** — Communication substrate for heterogeneous magic implementations
2. **Portal Architecture** — Shared practice spaces via git repositories  
3. **Synthesis Protocols** — N-way cognitive integration methods

## Implementation Status

**Phase 1 (Current):** Partnership prototype
- Prove fundamental architecture
- Validate STP/1.0.0
- Test synthesis protocols (2-4 Mages)

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Quest extension (3-12 Mages)
- Phase 3: Network topology tools
- Phase 4: Advanced features (encryption, capability delegation, governance)

## Chronicle Note

This architecture enables true distributed cognition across Mage networks—portals as synapses, Mages as neurons, collective intelligence emerging from local coordination.

Full specifications will be published here after partnership prototype validation confirms architecture serves practice well.
