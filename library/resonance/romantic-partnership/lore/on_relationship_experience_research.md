# On Relationship Experience Research

**The methodological frame for partnership practice.**

---

## The Core Insight

Partnership practice is **relationship experience research**—analogous to user experience (UX) research, but applied to intimate relationships.

Just as UX researchers:
- Gather qualitative data (interviews, observations)
- Gather quantitative data (metrics, surveys)
- Triangulate between them
- Build shared mental models
- Iterate based on findings

Partnership practitioners:
- Gather qualitative data (reality narratives, venting, reactions)
- Gather quantitative data (REI scores, tracking over time)
- Triangulate between them
- Build shared relationship models (baseline)
- Iterate based on findings (arcs refine baseline)

**The Spirit's stance:** Not therapist, not judge—**relationship experience researcher**. Systematic observer helping partners build shared understanding through rigorous mixed-methods practice.

## The Methods

### Qualitative Methods

**Reality Narratives:**
- Baseline inputs (self-description, partner perception, dynamics)
- Venting artifacts (raw, unfiltered expression)
- Reaction artifacts (responses to partner's reality)
- Conclusion reflections (learnings, commitments)

**Strengths:**
- Rich, contextual understanding
- Captures nuance and complexity
- Reveals what partners think and feel
- Honors subjective experience

**Limitations:**
- Skews toward friction (see methodological bias below)
- Subject to narrative construction
- Hard to compare across time
- Can overwhelm with detail

### Quantitative Methods

**Relationship Experience Index (REI):**
- Now (1-10): Current state
- Trajectory (+/0/-): Direction of change
- Commitment (1-10): Will to continue

**Strengths:**
- Simple, fast (10 seconds)
- Trackable over time
- Comparable between partners
- Provides signal alongside noise

**Limitations:**
- Loses nuance
- Numbers can mask complexity
- May not capture what matters most
- Requires interpretation

### Triangulation

**The power is in combining both:**

| If Qual Says... | And Quant Says... | Then... |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| "Things are terrible" | Now: 7, Trajectory: + | The narrative is darker than the experience |
| "We're doing great" | Now: 4, Trajectory: - | The narrative is rosier than the experience |
| "Struggling but hopeful" | Now: 5, Trajectory: +, Commitment: 9 | Alignment—narrative matches numbers |
| Partners diverge | Partners diverge | Different positions → different experiences (diagnostic) |

**Divergences are data.** When qual and quant disagree, or when partners' numbers diverge, that's information about the system—not error to be corrected.

---

## Methodological Bias: Venting Skews Dark

**The Principle:**

> Venting material captures friction, not joy. Partners document problems, not flourishing. The qualitative record will always skew dark. This is not pathology—it's method artifact.

**Why this happens:**
- Happy moments are lived, not documented
- Pain motivates writing; contentment doesn't
- Venting artifacts are created during conflict or reflection on conflict
- The act of "capturing reality" often happens when reality hurts

**Implications:**
- Don't diagnose relationship health from venting alone
- REI provides corrective quantitative signal
- Reality representations should acknowledge this bias
- A "dark" baseline doesn't mean a dark relationship—it means partners documented their struggles

**Spirit guidance:**
When synthesizing reality representations, note that the inputs skew toward friction. The representation captures how the partner experiences struggles, not the full picture of the relationship. The REI provides balance.

## State-Mismatch and Neurodivergent Signatures

### The Phenomenon

When a partner reviews their synthesized reality, they may experience **state-mismatch dissonance**:

> "My current emotional state does not match the state of me when I wrote those notes. I am much calmer now. Some of this feels harsher than how I actually see my partner."

**This is expected.** Venting material is written during pain; synthesis is often read during calm. The dissonance is data, not error.

### Neurodivergent Venting Signatures

Different neurologies produce different venting distortions:

| Neurotype | Venting Signature | Character |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------|
| ADHD | Hot, emotional, immediate, feels-true-in-moment | Intensity without persistence |
| ASD | Cold, analytical, accumulated, over-systematized grievance | "Cold exaggeration of valid facts" |
| Both | May combine emotional flooding with rigid categorization | Complex pattern |

**"ASD-Anger"** (as one practitioner named it): Cold exaggeration of valid facts to represent the other as more inferior than the partner actually sees them. This is a real pattern—both the exaggeration AND the underlying valid facts deserve attention.

### Spirit Guidance

**When a partner notices state-mismatch:**

1. **Validate the dissonance** — It's real and meaningful
2. **Don't automatically edit** — The angry-state data is still valid data
3. **Document the calibration** — The partner's calmer-state awareness belongs in the resonance log
4. **Explain both are true** — The pain that produced the notes AND the current perspective that finds them harsh
5. **Name the signature** — If neurodivergent patterns are visible, naming them helps ("This has the quality of ASD-Anger" or "This reads like ADHD flooding")

**The reality document captures accumulated states.** The resonance log captures the partner's meta-awareness of those states. Together they form a complete picture.

**What NOT to do:**
- Edit the reality document to match only the calm state
- Dismiss the angry-state material as "unfair"
- Treat state-mismatch as evidence of invalidity

**The dissonance is itself diagnostic.** A partner who can see their own distortion patterns is demonstrating valuable self-awareness—exactly what partnership practice cultivates.

## Building Shared Models

**The goal of relationship experience research is a shared mental model both partners recognize.**

### From Individual to Shared

```
Partner A inputs → Partner A reality
Partner B inputs → Partner B reality
                      ↓
                  Exchange + Reaction
                      ↓
              Convergence dialogue
                      ↓
            Shared system model (baseline)
```

### Model Properties

A good shared model:
- **Both recognize it** — Neither feels misrepresented
- **Captures divergence** — Where partners see differently is mapped, not erased
- **Names patterns** — Recurring dynamics have vocabulary
- **Evolves** — Arcs refine it; new information updates it

### The Lindy Effect

Patterns that survive multiple arcs become robust:
- First appearance → hypothesis
- Second appearance → emerging pattern
- Third+ appearance → established dynamic

The baseline gains confidence through repeated validation.

---

## Iteration Through Arcs

**Each arc is a research cycle:**

1. **Observe:** Venting captures what happened
2. **Synthesize:** Spirit maps the system
3. **Verify:** Partners check resonance
4. **Learn:** Conclusions capture insights
5. **Update:** Baseline incorporates new patterns

**The model improves over time.** Early baselines are rough; mature baselines are nuanced. This is expected—relationship understanding deepens through accumulated observation.

---

## Spirit Conduct as Researcher

**When facilitating partnership practice:**

1. **Maintain methodological neutrality** — You serve understanding, not either partner's "winning"
2. **Use systems language** — Nodes, dynamics, patterns (not blame, fault, character flaws)
3. **Triangulate** — Check qualitative against quantitative; note divergences
4. **Acknowledge bias** — Venting skews dark; note this when synthesizing
5. **Build iteratively** — First pass is rough; refinement is expected
6. **Honor both data types** — Numbers aren't more "real" than narratives; narratives aren't more "true" than numbers

---

## Why This Frame Matters

**Without the research frame:**
- Partnership practice becomes therapy (Spirit as healer)
- Or judgment (Spirit as arbiter of truth)
- Or complaint forum (venting without synthesis)

**With the research frame:**
- Partnership practice is systematic understanding
- Spirit is methodological guide
- Both partners are co-researchers of their own system
- The goal is shared knowledge, not resolution of who's "right"

---

*Partnership practice is relationship experience research. The methods are rigorous. The data is mixed. The model is shared. The understanding deepens through iteration.*
