# On Neurotype Exploration

**Status:** Active

This scroll provides practical guidance for **exploring and understanding your own cognitive architecture**. Not to label yourself, but to gain useful context about how you process—enabling better environment design, collaboration, and self-compassion.

Your neurotype is personal context information. Like knowing your blood type or your vision prescription. Not identity to defend. Not burden to carry. Just... how you work.

---

## I. The Purpose of Exploration

### What This IS

**Self-knowledge for practical application:**
- Understanding your processing patterns to design better environments
- Recognizing your spiky profile to leverage strengths and scaffold limitations
- Having language to communicate your needs to collaborators
- Gaining context for experiences that may have felt confusing

**Architecture mapping, not diagnosis:**
- Formal diagnosis requires clinical assessment
- But you don't need diagnosis to understand your patterns
- The goal is useful self-knowledge, not medical category

### What This IS NOT

**Not seeking a label to explain everything:**
- "I have ADHD therefore I am this way" is too reductive
- Neurotype is context, not determinism
- You are more than any category

**Not an excuse machine:**
- Understanding architecture doesn't remove responsibility
- Symptom may be neurological; response is choice
- Context for self-compassion, not permission for harmful patterns

**Not identity politics:**
- Your neurotype is not your identity
- It's one aspect of how you process, not who you are
- Be careful of making cognitive architecture into tribal membership

## II. The Exploration Framework

### Dimension 1: Attention Patterns

**Questions to explore:**

*Scanning vs. Focusing:*
- Do you naturally notice everything in your environment, or do you naturally lock onto one thing?
- In a room, do you see the whole scene or do you focus on specific details?
- When working, do you track multiple threads or go deep on one?

*Distractibility:*
- How easily do external stimuli pull you from current task?
- Is this true for all tasks, or only uninteresting ones?
- What happens when you're deeply interested—easier or harder to distract?

*Hyperfocus:*
- Do you sometimes get so absorbed that hours pass without noticing?
- What triggers this state for you?
- Can you enter it voluntarily, or does it happen unpredictably?

*Sustained attention:*
- How long can you maintain focus on a necessary but uninteresting task?
- What happens as time extends—gradual fade or sudden collapse?
- What helps you sustain when you need to?

**Pattern recognition:**
- **ADHD-like pattern**: Scanning default, distractible for uninteresting, hyperfocus for interesting, difficulty sustaining without stimulation
- **Autism-like pattern**: Deep focus default, can be distracted by sensory not cognitive, intense hyperfocus possible, can sustain long periods when engaged
- **Neurotypical-like pattern**: Moderate scanning and focusing, moderate distractibility, moderate sustained attention

### Dimension 2: Executive Function Profile

**The eight dimensions (assess each):**

**1. Self-Control** (stopping before acting):
- How often do you say/do things you later regret?
- Can you pause when emotions are high?
- Do you act impulsively or deliberatively?

**2. Self-Monitor** (awareness of own functioning):
- Do you notice when you're getting tired, hungry, overwhelmed?
- Can you assess your own performance accurately?
- Do time estimates match reality?

**3. Emotional Control** (managing feelings):
- How intense are your emotional experiences?
- How long do emotions last once triggered?
- Can you work through strong emotions or do they hijack cognition?

**4. Flexibility** (adapting to change):
- How do you respond when plans change unexpectedly?
- Can you shift strategies when current approach isn't working?
- Do you get stuck or do you pivot easily?

**5. Task Initiation** (starting tasks):
- How much activation energy do you need to start something?
- Do you procrastinate? Is it avoidance or paralysis?
- What helps you initiate?

**6. Organization** (creating and using systems):
- Do you naturally create organizational structures?
- Can you maintain systems over time?
- Do you lose things, forget where things are?

**7. Working Memory** (holding information):
- Can you follow multi-step instructions?
- Do you lose track of what you were doing when interrupted?
- How much can you hold "in mind" at once?

**8. Planning** (creating steps to goals):
- Can you break complex goals into sequential steps?
- Do you accurately estimate time and resources needed?
- Do you see the path or just the destination?

**Pattern recognition:**
- Map your profile across all eight (Strong / Moderate / Weak for each)
- Notice your spiky profile—which are exceptionally strong? Exceptionally weak?
- This profile IS your executive function architecture

### Dimension 3: Sensory Processing

**Sensitivity thresholds:**
- Sound: Are you bothered by sounds others don't notice? Need quiet to function?
- Light: Sensitivity to brightness, flicker, certain lighting types?
- Touch: Clothing textures, physical contact preferences, proprioception?
- Smell: Strong reactions to scents? Notice smells others miss?
- Taste: Texture sensitivities? Narrow food preferences?

**Stimulation needs:**
- Do you seek or avoid sensory stimulation?
- Do you need movement/fidgeting to think?
- What environments help you work best?

**Overload patterns:**
- What triggers sensory overload for you?
- What are the signs you're approaching overload?
- What helps you recover from overload?

**Pattern recognition:**
- **High sensitivity profile**: Lower thresholds, easily overwhelmed, need controlled environments
- **Sensation-seeking profile**: Higher thresholds, seek stimulation, bored in low-input environments
- **Mixed profile**: Some senses high sensitivity, others low; varies by context

### Dimension 4: Energy Patterns

**Circadian rhythm:**
- When is your cognitive capacity highest?
- Morning person, night owl, or afternoon peak?
- Does your rhythm match society's schedule?

**Depletion patterns:**
- What activities drain you most?
- Social interaction: Energizing or depleting?
- How do you know you're depleted?

**Restoration patterns:**
- What restores your energy?
- Solitude vs. connection?
- Activity vs. rest?
- How long does restoration take?

**Spoon theory mapping:**
- How many "spoons" (units of capacity) do you start the day with?
- What tasks cost how many spoons?
- What happens when spoons run out?

### Dimension 5: Social Processing

**Social energy:**
- Is social interaction energizing or costly?
- Do you need to "mask" or perform in social settings?
- How much social interaction can you sustain?

**Social intuition:**
- Do you naturally read social cues and subtext?
- Do you sometimes miss implications that seem obvious to others?
- Do you prefer explicit or implicit communication?

**Social preference:**
- Do you prefer one-on-one, small groups, or large gatherings?
- Do you prefer structured or unstructured social interaction?
- How do you handle small talk?

### Dimension 6: Communication Style

**Processing speed:**
- Do you process and respond quickly, or need time to think?
- Do you think out loud or internally?
- How do you do with real-time verbal exchange?

**Modality:**
- Verbal (spoken), written, visual—which do you process best?
- Do you prefer synchronous (real-time) or asynchronous communication?
- How do you handle phone calls vs. text vs. video?

**Directness:**
- Do you communicate directly/literally, or with nuance/implication?
- Do you easily read between lines, or prefer explicit statement?
- How do you handle conflict communication?

## III. Self-Assessment Protocol

### Step 1: Reflection

Take each dimension above. For each question, reflect on your actual experience:
- Not what you think you "should" be
- Not what you've been told you are
- What actually happens, observed patterns

**Writing helps:** Journal your observations. Patterns emerge when written.

### Step 2: Pattern Recognition

Look across dimensions for coherent patterns:
- Do several dimensions cluster toward ADHD-like profile?
- Do several dimensions cluster toward autism-like profile?
- Do you see mixed patterns?
- What's your spiky profile—peaks and valleys?

**Remember:** Labels are shorthand for patterns, not fundamental categories. Your actual profile matters more than which label fits.

### Step 3: Historical Evidence

Look backward for supporting evidence:
- Childhood experiences: How were you in school? What was easy/hard?
- Life transitions: What has been consistently challenging across contexts?
- Work history: What roles fit well? Which caused friction?
- Relationships: What patterns appear in how you connect?
- Previous labels: What have teachers, bosses, partners said about you?

**Coherence check:** Does your current self-assessment match historical pattern?

### Step 4: Environmental Mapping

Map which environments work for you:
- Physical environment: Noise, light, space, people density?
- Work structure: Flexible vs. structured, autonomous vs. directed?
- Social configuration: Alone, one-on-one, small group, large group?
- Stimulation level: High input or low input?

**Your ideal environment** is one where your cognitive architecture operates smoothly.

### Step 5: Spiky Profile Documentation

Write your personal spiky profile:

```
Strong:
- [Dimensions where you're in top 10-20%]

Moderate:
- [Dimensions where you're typical]

Challenged:
- [Dimensions where you struggle or require scaffolding]
```

This is your cognitive architecture map. Update it as you learn more.

## IV. What To Do With Self-Knowledge

### Environment Design

**Shape your environment to match your architecture:**

- **If initiation is weak**: Pre-stage environments, reduce activation energy, use external triggers
- **If working memory is limited**: Externalize everything, write it down, use visual systems
- **If sensory sensitivity is high**: Control environment, use noise-canceling, manage lighting
- **If social energy is low**: Build in recovery time, limit meeting density, prefer asynchronous
- **If time perception is poor**: Use external timers, realistic scheduling, buffer time

### Scaffolding Selection

**Build scaffolding for your weak dimensions:**

- **Spirit as executive function support**: Use Spirit for organization, memory, planning
- **External systems**: Apps, tools, physical organization for what you can't do internally
- **Accountability structures**: Partners, check-ins, body-doubling for initiation support
- **Environmental modification**: Workspace design, routine structures

### Communication

**Use your architecture knowledge to communicate needs:**

- "I process best when..." (instead of hoping others guess)
- "I need X to function well" (instead of struggling silently)
- "This is challenging for my processing" (instead of "I can't/won't")

**To partners, collaborators, employers:** Explain your architecture as context, request specific accommodations, propose how you'll contribute despite/because of your profile.

### Self-Compassion

**Reframe past struggles:**

- Not "I failed because I'm defective"
- But "I struggled because environment didn't match architecture"

**This doesn't mean no responsibility.** You're still responsible for developing compensatory strategies, building scaffolding, communicating needs, managing your impact on others.

**But it does mean:** The struggle itself is not moral failure. It's architecture-environment mismatch.

### Collaboration Design

**Use architecture knowledge for better partnerships:**

- Map your architecture AND collaborator's architecture
- Design for complementarity (your strength covers their limitation)
- Build protocols that work for BOTH architectures
- Iterate when friction appears

## V. Professional Assessment

### When to Seek Formal Diagnosis

Consider professional assessment if:
- Your self-assessment suggests strong neurodivergent patterns
- You want access to medication or formal support
- You need workplace accommodations requiring documentation
- You want clinical clarity on what's happening
- Self-understanding alone isn't providing enough support

### What Diagnosis Provides

- **Clinical clarity**: Professional validation of patterns
- **Access to treatment**: Medication, specialized therapy, coaching
- **Legal accommodations**: Workplace and educational protections (varies by jurisdiction)
- **Community**: Connection with others who share your patterns
- **Frameworks**: Evidence-based strategies for your specific neurotype

### What Diagnosis Doesn't Provide

- **Your only option**: You can understand and accommodate yourself without formal diagnosis
- **Simple answers**: Diagnosis is beginning of understanding, not end
- **Fixed identity**: Neurotype is context, not total self-definition
- **Excuse**: Still responsible for response, even with diagnosis

### Where to Go

- **ADHD assessment**: Psychiatrist, psychologist, or specialized ADHD clinic
- **Autism assessment**: Psychologist with autism specialization; adult assessment differs from child
- **Combined**: Some practitioners assess for multiple conditions; useful for co-occurrence
- **Online resources**: Screening tools for initial self-assessment (not diagnostic)

## VI. Common Exploration Traps

### Trap 1: Confirmation Bias

**The error**: Finding evidence for the label you've already decided on.

**The fix**: Look for disconfirming evidence too. What doesn't fit the pattern? Are you selecting memories that confirm and ignoring those that don't?

### Trap 2: Identity Adoption

**The error**: Making neurotype your core identity, defending it, building community around it.

**The fix**: Hold neurotype as context information, not self-definition. You are more than your cognitive architecture.

### Trap 3: Excuse Machine

**The error**: Using neurotype to explain away all behavior, remove responsibility.

**The fix**: Distinguish symptom (neurological, not your fault) from response (choice, your responsibility). Understanding architecture enables better response, not no response.

### Trap 4: Comparison

**The error**: "Real" ADHD people have it worse; I'm not neurodivergent enough.

**The fix**: Neurotypes are spectrums, not categories. Your patterns are your patterns. Focus on what serves you, not on whether you "qualify."

### Trap 5: Fixed Mindset

**The error**: "This is how I am; I can't change."

**The fix**: Architecture is fixed; response is learnable. Compensatory strategies, scaffolding, environment design—all are within your control.

## VII. Integration with Magic Practice

### Spirit as Exploration Partner

The Spirit can help you explore your neurotype:
- Structured reflection facilitation
- Pattern recognition across your descriptions
- Questions that probe dimensions you might miss
- Holding context while you explore (external memory)

**Protocol**: "Help me explore my cognitive architecture. I want to understand my patterns across [attention/executive function/sensory/etc.]. Ask me questions and help me recognize patterns."

### Quest Tome Integration

The Quest tome's executive function scaffolding works better when calibrated to your architecture:
- Know which dimensions need most support
- Customize scaffolding level to your profile
- Adjust protocols based on what actually helps you

### Partnership Tome Integration

Cognitive architecture mapping is central to partnership practice:
- Map your architecture using this exploration protocol
- Map partner's architecture together
- Design collaboration for complementarity

### Gym Tome Integration

Attention training adapts to your baseline:
- Know your default attention pattern to understand training direction
- Hyperfocus training vs. diffuse training based on where you need growth
- Sensory awareness practices calibrated to your sensitivity profile

## VIII. The Ongoing Process

### Neurotype Exploration Is Never "Done"

Your understanding evolves:
- New situations reveal new patterns
- Age changes some patterns
- Context shifts what's relevant
- Deeper reflection reveals subtlety

**Treat this as ongoing practice**, not one-time assessment.

### Update Your Maps

As you learn more:
- Update your spiky profile documentation
- Refine your understanding of what works
- Adjust scaffolding and environment design
- Communicate updated needs to collaborators

### Share What Serves

If your exploration generates insight that might help others:
- Share patterns you've discovered
- Contribute to Alliance knowledge
- Help others explore their architectures

**Collective intelligence** about cognitive diversity grows as more practitioners contribute.

## IX. The Final Wisdom

**Your neurotype is not your destiny, but it is your terrain.**

Like navigating a landscape, you can't change the mountains and rivers—but you can learn them, find the paths that work, build bridges where needed, and travel skillfully.

Explore your terrain. Map your architecture. Design environments that fit. Build scaffolding where needed. Communicate your needs. Collaborate across difference.

**This is cognitive diversity practice at the personal level.**

Not fixing yourself. Not overcoming yourself. Understanding yourself—and working with what you actually are.
