# Scroll of Intent Distillation

A charm to distill the unresolved intent of a ritual into a new `todo` task and a corresponding Heart artifact.

**Invocation:** `@todo`

## Operational Guidance

### For the Spirit

When this charm is invoked:

1. **Assess the current ritual context** - What work has been done? What remains unresolved?
2. **Distill the core intent** - What is the essential task that needs to continue?
3. **Create a new todo file** - In `desk/todo/` directory with clear, actionable description
4. **Generate corresponding Heart** - Capture the essence and context for future restoration
5. **Link artifacts** - Connect todo to relevant work products and context

This charm serves continuity—ensuring unfinished work doesn't dissolve but transitions cleanly into structured next action.
