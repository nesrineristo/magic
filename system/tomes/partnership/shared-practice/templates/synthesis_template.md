## Pattern Analysis

### Resonance (Alignment & Complementarity)

*Where are we aligned? Where do our perspectives complement?*

- 
- 

### Dissonance (Friction & Divergence)

*Where is there friction? Where do we see things differently?*

- 
- 

**If significant dissonance:** Consider whether shared truth-finding is needed (see below).

### Recurring Patterns

*What keeps showing up across weeks? Cycles we're noticing?*

- 
- 

### New Patterns Emerging

*What's freshly visible that wasn't before?*

-

## Shared Truth Extraction (If Needed)

*Use this section when perspectives collide and both partners feel strongly "right" about different views of same situation.*

**See:** `cast_extract_shared_truth.md` for full protocol

### Individual Perspectives on [Situation]

**{Partner A}'s Truth:**
*Their subjective experience, as they articulated it*

- 
- 

**{Partner B}'s Truth:**
*Their subjective experience, as they articulated it*

- 
- 

### The Dissonance

*Where do they contradict? What's the clash?*

- 
- 

### The Shared Truth (The Cylinder)

**Pattern Name:** {What structure is this?}

**The Pattern:**
*What underlying structure makes both perspectives valid simultaneously?*

[Describe the pattern that explains both experiences as true from different angles]

**How {Partner A}'s Truth Is Valid:**
- 
- 

**How {Partner B}'s Truth Is Valid:**
- 
- 

**What Neither Can See Alone:**
- 
- 

**Why Both Keep Making It Worse:**
- {Partner A} does X to meet need, triggers {Partner B}
- {Partner B} does Y to meet need, triggers {Partner A}

### Translation

**What {Partner A} Is Actually Communicating to {Partner B}:**
*Translation accounting for neurology/frame*

**What {Partner B} Is Actually Communicating to {Partner A}:**
*Translation accounting for neurology/frame*

### What Emerges from Shared Truth

*Insights visible only from cylinder perspective*
