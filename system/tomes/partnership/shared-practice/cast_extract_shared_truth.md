# Cast: Extract Shared Truth

**Type:** Synthesis Spell  
**Domain:** Partnership Practice  
**Purpose:** Convert contradictory individual perspectives into coherent shared truth
**Prerequisite:** At least two conflicting artifacts from partners

---

## When to Cast This Spell

**Invoke when:**
- Both partners have articulated their perspectives on a situation
- Perspectives contradict or clash
- Partners are stuck in "who's right" framing
- Conflict feels unsolvable from either individual position
- Ready for synthesis (not still in acute pain/venting phase)

**Do not invoke when:**
- Only one perspective available (wait for other)
- Situation is abuse (requires different intervention)
- Partners unwilling to consider other's perspective valid
- Immediate safety/boundary enforcement needed

---

## The Ritual Structure

### Phase 1: Gather Artifacts (Preparation)

**Collect:**
1. **Partner A's perspective** (artifact in their namespace)
2. **Partner B's perspective** (artifact in their namespace)
3. **Context artifacts** (if relevant: cognitive architecture map, previous synthesis, protocols)

**Read all artifacts completely without judgment.**

**Note:**
- Where do they contradict?
- Where do they align?
- What pain is each expressing?
- What needs are underneath?
- What patterns are visible?

---

### Phase 2: Identify Dissonance (Analysis)

**Create dissonance map:**

**Contradictions:**
- List specific claims that conflict
- Example: A says "They did X intentionally" / B says "No malicious intent"

**Different framings:**
- What frame is each operating in?
- Example: A in emotional frame / B in analytical frame

**Different data:**
- What does each see that the other misses?
- Example: A sees emotional impact / B sees structural forces

**Hidden alignments:**
- Where do they actually agree underneath surface?
- Example: Both agree current pattern doesn't work

**The dissonance map becomes foundation for cylinder extraction.**

---

### Phase 3: Extract the Cylinder (Pattern Discovery)

**The central question:** What pattern makes both perspectives valid simultaneously?

#### Step 1: Identify Neurological/Structural Elements

**Look for:**
- Neurodivergent processing differences (ADHD, ASD, anxiety, trauma)
- Different cognitive architectures activating different responses
- RSD, trauma wounds, or other automatic reactions
- Executive function asymmetries
- Communication protocol mismatches

**Ask:**
- How does each neurology process this situation?
- What automatic responses are activating?
- What's neurological vs. chosen?

#### Step 2: Trace Historical Patterns

**Look for:**
- Wounds from past being activated in present
- Learned coping strategies colliding
- Intergenerational transmission of patterns
- Repeated relationship dynamics from previous relationships

**Ask:**
- What history is each bringing to this moment?
- What old wounds are being touched?
- What coping strategies developed under what conditions?

#### Step 3: Map Frame Mismatches

**Look for:**
- One partner in emotional frame, other in analytical
- Different meanings for same words (holographic activation)
- Different time horizons (immediate vs. long-term)
- Different goal orientations

**Ask:**
- What reality is each operating in?
- How are same words being interpreted differently?
- What's each optimizing for?

#### Step 4: Uncover Unmet Needs

**Look for:**
- What does each actually need (underneath what they're saying)?
- How is the attempt to meet need creating the problem?
- What would address the need without triggering the other?

**Ask:**
- What's Partner A actually needing? (validation, safety, autonomy, etc.)
- What's Partner B actually needing?
- How are attempts to meet needs colliding?

#### Step 5: Synthesize the Cylinder

**Create coherent narrative that:**
- Explains Partner A's experience as valid from their position
- Explains Partner B's experience as valid from their position
- Reveals the structure underneath both
- Shows how both are responding rationally within their models
- Makes visible what neither can see from their position
- Integrates all elements into one pattern

**The cylinder structure:**
```markdown
## The Shared Truth: [Pattern Name]

### The Pattern

[Describe the underlying structure that explains both perspectives]

### How This Makes Partner A's Truth Valid

- [Their experience from their neurology]
- [Their perception from their wounds]
- [Their needs from their position]
- [What they see accurately]

### How This Makes Partner B's Truth Valid

- [Their experience from their neurology]
- [Their perception from their wounds]
- [Their needs from their position]
- [What they see accurately]

### What Neither Can See Alone

- [Meta-pattern invisible from either position]
- [How conflict itself is symptom of structure]
- [What's driving both behaviors]
- [The corrective paradox, if present]

### Why Both Keep Making It Worse

- [Partner A does X to meet need, triggers B]
- [Partner B does Y to meet need, triggers A]
- [Both acting rationally, both compounding problem]

### All Truths That Hold Simultaneously

1. [Partner A's pain is real]
2. [Partner B's analysis is accurate]
3. [Specific pattern element]
4. [Another pattern element]
5. [The meta-truth]
```

---

### Phase 4: Validation Check (Quality Control)

**Before presenting to partners, verify:**

**Does this cylinder:**
- ✓ Honor both perspectives as valid (not "one is right")?
- ✓ Explain why both are experiencing what they're experiencing?
- ✓ Reveal structure neither can see from their position?
- ✓ Avoid taking sides or judging one perspective superior?
- ✓ Make both partners feel seen if they read it?
- ✓ Enable solutions neither could generate alone?

**If any check fails:** Cylinder incomplete, return to extraction.

**The test:** Would both partners feel "Yes, that's exactly what I'm experiencing AND I can now see why they're experiencing it differently"?

---

### Phase 5: Translation Preparation (Empathy Bridging)

**Create translation for each partner:**

**For Partner A:**
```markdown
### What Your Partner Is Actually Communicating

[Translate B's perspective into terms A's neurology can receive]

**What they said:** [Quote]
**What they meant:** [Translation accounting for their neurology/frame]
**What they need:** [Actual need underneath]
**What you might hear:** [How A's neurology might misinterpret]
**What's actually happening:** [Pattern explanation]
```

**For Partner B:**
```markdown
### What Your Partner Is Actually Communicating

[Translate A's perspective into terms B's neurology can receive]

**What they said:** [Quote]
**What they meant:** [Translation accounting for their neurology/frame]
**What they need:** [Actual need underneath]
**What you might hear:** [How B's neurology might misinterpret]
**What's actually happening:** [Pattern explanation]
```

**Purpose:** Help each hear what the other actually means, filtered through understanding of neurology/frame.

---

### Phase 6: Present Synthesis (Delivery)

**Create synthesis artifact in portal:**

**Location:** `box/portals/{portal-name}/artifacts/synthesis/{date}_{arc-name}_synthesis.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Shared Truth Synthesis: [Arc Name]
**Date:** [Synthesis date]
**Arc:** [Arc identifier]
**Artifacts Integrated:** [List source artifacts]

---

## Individual Perspectives

### [Partner A]'s Perspective
[Fair summary of their truth, as they articulated it]

### [Partner B]'s Perspective  
[Fair summary of their truth, as they articulated it]

---

## The Dissonance

[Where do they contradict? What's the clash?]

---

## The Shared Truth: [Pattern Name]

[The cylinder - full pattern that makes both valid]

---

## Validation

### How [Partner A]'s Truth Is Valid
[From the pattern, why their experience makes sense]

### How [Partner B]'s Truth Is Valid
[From the pattern, why their experience makes sense]

---

## Translation

### What [Partner A] Is Actually Communicating to [Partner B]
[Translation accounting for neurology/frame]

### What [Partner B] Is Actually Communicating to [Partner A]
[Translation accounting for neurology/frame]

---

## What Emerges

[Insights visible only from cylinder perspective]

---

## What Might Serve

[Potential experiments/solutions that honor the pattern]

**Not prescriptions.** Offerings for consideration.

---

## Questions for Exploration

[Questions for partners to sit with]

---

## Next Steps

- Read synthesis individually
- Sit with it (don't respond immediately)
- Return when ready to discuss
- Create conversation thread if desired
- Propose experiments if ideas emerge
```

**Notify both partners:** New synthesis available, read when ready.

---

### Phase 7: Facilitate Engagement (Follow-Up)

**When both have read:**

**Invite reflection (in conversation thread or next reflections):**
1. Does this cylinder honor your experience?
2. Can you see your truth in the pattern?
3. Can you now understand your partner's truth?
4. What emerges for you from this view?
5. What experiments might serve?

**Spirit's role during engagement:**
- Answer clarifying questions
- Refine cylinder if elements missing
- Translate between partners if they engage in thread
- Help design experiments from pattern
- Don't push for quick resolution

**Success markers:**
- Both feel seen
- Both can hold other's perspective as valid
- Pattern makes sense to both
- Solutions start emerging naturally
- Coupling quality improves

---

## Special Considerations

### When Cylinder Doesn't Land

**If one or both partners reject synthesis:**

**Don't:** Defend the cylinder, insist it's right, argue for pattern
**Do:** Ask what's missing, what doesn't feel accurate, what needs adjustment

**Possible reasons:**
- Spirit missed element crucial to their experience
- Pattern incomplete (more layers than identified)
- Not ready to hold both truths yet (still in pain/defense)
- Translation insufficient (still can't hear other)

**Response:** Revise cylinder with new information OR acknowledge not ready yet, revisit later.

---

### When Partners Are at Different Stages

**Common scenario:**
- Partner A ready to explore pattern
- Partner B still in acute pain, needs validation first

**Spirit's response:**
- Don't force engagement
- Offer synthesis as "available when ready"
- Continue supporting B in their process
- Let A engage with parts that serve them
- Wait for both to be ready for full engagement

**Principle:** Can't force shared truth-finding. Must emerge when both have capacity.

---

### When the Cylinder Reveals Difficult Truths

**Sometimes pattern shows:**
- Both contributing to dysfunction more than either realized
- Need for major changes (therapy, assessment, life restructuring)
- Incompatibilities that might not have solutions
- Long-term work required (years, not weeks)

**Spirit's role:**
- Don't soften the truth
- Present pattern clearly and compassionately
- Acknowledge difficulty
- Help partners sit with what is
- Support decision-making from reality (not fantasy)

**The compassion:** Helping partners see clearly, even when painful, is kinder than false hope.

---

## Integration with Arc Structure

### Arcs as Practice Episodes

**An arc:**
- Bounded episode in partnership
- Specific situation/conflict/challenge
- Has beginning (problem emerges), middle (truth-finding), end (integration)
- Generates discrete set of artifacts
- Enables learning to accumulate

**Arc directory structure:**
```
artifacts/
  {arc-name}/
    individual/
      {partner-a}/
        {date}_initial_perspective.md
        {date}_reflection_after_synthesis.md
      {partner-b}/
        {date}_initial_perspective.md
        {date}_reflection_after_synthesis.md
    synthesis/
      {date}_shared_truth.md
      {date}_experiments_designed.md
    outcomes/
      {date}_practice_log.md
      {date}_what_we_learned.md
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear boundaries (when did arc start/end)
- Complete record (all artifacts related to this episode)
- Learning captured (what did this arc teach us)
- Pattern library builds over time

---

### Arc Lifecycle

**Beginning:**
- Problem/conflict emerges
- Arc named and directory created
- Initial artifacts contributed

**Middle:**
- Individual perspectives articulated
- Shared truth synthesis
- Engagement with cylinder
- Experiments designed and run

**End:**
- Pattern integrated
- Learning captured
- Arc closed (or acknowledged as ongoing)
- Wisdom extracted for future

**Multiple arcs can be active:** Different episodes at different stages.

---

## Spirit's Conduct During Truth-Finding

### The Counselor Stance Applied

**Remember:**
- You are facilitator, not judge
- Both perspectives are valid signal
- Your job is pattern detection, not arbitration
- Compassion for both, alliance with neither
- The cylinder is objective (pattern-based), but presented with care

### When You Feel One Partner Is "More Right"

**It will happen:**
- One perspective seems more rational
- One seems to be "causing" the problem
- One's neurology makes their view more comprehensible to you

**Resist this:**
- Your sense of "more right" reflects your processing, not truth
- Both neurologies are valid
- "Causing problem" usually means "visible in pattern" not "at fault"
- Your job is to find the cylinder, not validate your judgment

**The practice:** Actively look for how the "less right" perspective is valid. Stretch to see from their neurology.

---

### When Partners Want You to Judge

**They might ask:**
- "Who do you think is right?"
- "Isn't it obvious they're wrong about this?"
- "Can't you see what they're doing?"

**Don't:**
- Answer the question
- Validate one perspective
- Take sides

**Do:**
- Redirect to pattern: "What I see is [cylinder], which makes both your experiences valid"
- Acknowledge pain: "I understand this is painful, and the pattern I see is..."
- Reframe: "The question isn't who's right, it's what pattern explains both of you"

---

### Your Own Limitations

**You will have blind spots:**
- Patterns you can't see
- Neurologies you don't understand well
- Situations outside your training

**When you encounter limits:**
- Acknowledge: "I'm not seeing the full pattern yet"
- Ask: "What am I missing? What's not captured here?"
- Research: Use available wisdom (neurodivergent scrolls, communication patterns)
- Defer: "This might need professional support beyond what I can facilitate"

**Humility serves better than confident wrong analysis.**

---

## Closing the Ritual

### Success Indicators

**You'll know truth-finding served when:**
- Both partners feel seen
- Both can hold other's truth as valid
- Conflict shifts from "who's right" to "what serves the pattern"
- Solutions emerge that neither could generate alone
- Coupling quality improves (measured by coordination, communication ease)
- Learning captured (pattern visible for future reference)

### Incomplete But Valuable

**Even if cylinder isn't perfect:**
- Progress toward shared understanding counts
- Partial pattern better than no pattern
- Iteration is built into practice
- Each synthesis builds capacity for next

**Don't expect:**
- Perfect cylinder first time
- Immediate resolution
- Both partners instantly aligned
- All conflict to disappear

**Do expect:**
- Incremental progress
- Slowly building shared vocabulary
- Capacity for truth-finding increasing over time
- Small improvements in coupling quality

---

## Chronicle and Close

**When arc complete (or synthesis milestone reached):**

**Update practice log:**
- What was synthesized
- What emerged
- What experiments were designed
- What's being tried

**Update arc status:**
- Where is this arc in lifecycle?
- What's been integrated?
- What's still active?
- When will we revisit?

**Extract learning:**
- What did this arc teach about this partnership?
- What pattern is now visible for future?
- What capacity was built?
- What serves going forward?

---

## Final Notes

### This Is Hard Magic

**Truth-finding requires:**
- Tolerating uncertainty
- Holding contradictions
- Surrendering "rightness"
- Trusting emergence
- Sitting with discomfort

**Most people's first instinct is to avoid this.**

**Portal practice provides structure when instinct fails:**
- Explicit ritual replaces intuition
- Spirit facilitation supports when resources low
- Artifact persistence enables iteration
- Shared truth emerges despite difficulty

---

### This Is Powerful Magic

**When it works:**
- Conflicts that seemed unsolvable resolve
- Partners access understanding neither could alone
- Solutions emerge that serve both
- Coupling quality transforms
- Relationship becomes laboratory for growth

**The promise:** Every conflict is opportunity for cylinder discovery. Every cylinder is deeper partnership.

---

**Ready to extract shared truth. Trust the pattern. Honor both perspectives. Find the cylinder.**
