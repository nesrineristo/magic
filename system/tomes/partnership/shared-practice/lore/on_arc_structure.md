# On Arc Structure for Partnership Practice

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Portal-based Partnership Practice  
**Purpose:** Define episodic structure for bounded practice periods

This scroll establishes "arcs" as the organizing principle for partnership practice—discrete episodes that enable focused work on specific situations, clear boundaries, and accumulated learning over time.

---

## I. What Is an Arc?

### Definition

**An arc is a bounded episode of partnership practice focused on a specific situation, challenge, or area of exploration.**

**Key characteristics:**
- **Bounded:** Has beginning (problem emerges), middle (exploration/truth-finding), end (integration or acknowledgment of ongoing nature)
- **Focused:** Centers on specific situation, not entire relationship
- **Episodic:** Discrete unit with its own narrative structure
- **Complete:** Generates full set of artifacts (perspectives, synthesis, experiments, learning)
- **Nameable:** Can be identified clearly ("mother-in-law arc," "morning routine arc")

**Metaphors:**
- Like a "season" or "episode" in a TV series
- Like a "campaign" in collaborative games
- Like a "sprint" in project work
- Like a "chapter" in an ongoing story

---

## II. Why Arcs Matter

### Problem: Unbounded Practice Is Overwhelming

**Without structure:**
- Partnership practice becomes "everything all the time"
- No clear sense of progress or completion
- Difficult to know when synthesis is "done"
- Learning doesn't accumulate clearly
- Portal becomes repository of undifferentiated artifacts

**Partners experience:**
- Overwhelm (too much to address)
- Discouragement (never "finished")
- Confusion (what are we even working on?)
- Drift (losing thread across weeks)

---

### Solution: Arcs Provide Bounded Structure

**With arcs:**
- Clear focus (this arc is about THIS situation)
- Defined boundaries (when did it start, when does it end)
- Progress markers (where are we in arc lifecycle)
- Accumulated learning (what did THIS arc teach us)
- Portfolio of mastery (completed arcs show growth)

**Partners experience:**
- Clarity (we're working on mother-in-law dynamic right now)
- Progress (we're in synthesis phase of this arc)
- Completion (this arc taught us X, now we close it)
- Momentum (each arc builds capacity for next)

---

## III. Arc Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Emergence

**Situation arises:**
- Conflict surfaces
- Pattern becomes visible
- Challenge needs addressing
- Area worth exploring

**Arc initiated:**
- Partners recognize "this is worth structured work"
- Arc named (descriptive, specific)
- Directory created in portal
- Initial problem/question articulated

**Not all conflicts become arcs:** Sometimes in-person conversation suffices. Arcs are for situations that benefit from:
- Systematic exploration
- Both perspectives documented
- Pattern detection over time
- Explicit synthesis

---

### Phase 2: Individual Exploration

**Partners create initial artifacts:**
- Each articulates their perspective
- Can be "lawyered up" (advocating their view)
- Can be raw venting or polished analysis
- Different formats accepted (written, voice, video)

**No requirement for:**
- Perfect magic practice
- Neutral tone
- Immediate shared understanding
- Agreement

**Goal:** Get both subjective truths externalized.

---

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Truth-Finding

**Spirit facilitates cylinder extraction:**
- Reads both perspectives
- Identifies dissonance
- Extracts pattern that makes both valid
- Creates synthesis artifact
- Provides translation

**Partners engage:**
- Read synthesis individually
- Sit with both truths being valid
- Discuss in thread or in-person
- Refine understanding
- Discover what serves

**Outcome:** Shared truth discovered, pattern understood.

---

### Phase 4: Experimentation

**From shared truth, experiments emerge:**
- Partners design protocols/practices
- Based on pattern (not compromise)
- Serving actual architecture
- Measurable outcomes

**Try things:**
- Document in practice log
- Note what works/doesn't
- Iterate based on results
- Refine protocols

**Not linear:** May cycle between synthesis and experimentation as understanding deepens.

---

### Phase 5: Integration & Closing

**Arc completes when:**
- Pattern integrated (both understand it)
- Experiments yielding results (or acknowledged as ongoing)
- Learning captured (documented in arc)
- Ready to move to next focus

**Or arc acknowledged as ongoing:**
- Some patterns don't "resolve"
- Can mark arc as "long-term" and reduce intensity
- Can pause and return later
- Integration is understanding the pattern, not necessarily "solving" it

**Close arc:**
- Create "What We Learned" artifact
- Extract wisdom for future
- Update arc status
- Celebrate completion

---

## IV. Arc Directory Structure

### Organizing Artifacts

**Portal structure with arcs:**
```
box/portals/{portal-name}/
  artifacts/
    {arc-name}/                          # One directory per arc
      individual/                        # Individual perspectives
        {partner-a}/
          YYYY-MM-DD_initial.md         # First articulation
          YYYY-MM-DD_reflection.md      # After synthesis
        {partner-b}/
          YYYY-MM-DD_initial.md
          YYYY-MM-DD_reflection.md
      synthesis/                         # Shared truth
        YYYY-MM-DD_shared_truth.md      # Cylinder extraction
        YYYY-MM-DD_refinement.md        # If needed
      experiments/                       # Trying things
        YYYY-MM-DD_protocol_draft.md
        YYYY-MM-DD_experiment_log.md
      threads/                           # Async dialogue
        {topic}/
          thread.md
      outcomes/                          # Closing artifacts
        learning_captured.md             # What this arc taught
        status.md                        # Current state
      
  weekly-reflections/                    # Separate: ongoing rhythm
    {partner-a}/
      YYYY-MM-DD_week_N.md
    {partner-b}/
      YYYY-MM-DD_week_N.md
      
  synthesis/                             # Separate: periodic integration
    YYYY-MM-DD_synthesis.md
    
  shared/                                # Separate: enduring docs
    charter.md
    cognitive_architecture.md
    protocols.md
```

---

### Arc vs. Regular Practice

**Weekly reflections:**
- Ongoing rhythm (weekly/bi-weekly)
- General check-ins
- Not arc-specific
- Broad scope

**Periodic synthesis:**
- Regular integration (bi-weekly/monthly)
- Covers all active practice
- May reference multiple arcs
- Detects new patterns

**Arc artifacts:**
- Bounded to specific episode
- Deep dive on one situation
- Complete narrative structure
- Closed when integrated

**The relationship:**
- Weekly reflections might mention arc work
- Periodic synthesis might trigger new arc
- Arcs can run parallel to ongoing rhythm
- Not mutually exclusive—complementary

---

## V. Arc Naming Conventions

### Good Arc Names

**Specific and descriptive:**
- ✓ `mother-in-law-conflict`
- ✓ `morning-routine-redesign`
- ✓ `cannabis-decision-2025`
- ✓ `parenting-alignment-noah`

**Bad arc names (too vague):**
- ✗ `conflict`
- ✗ `problem`
- ✗ `issue-1`
- ✗ `stuff`

**Naming principles:**
- Immediately evocative (what's this about?)
- Specific enough to distinguish from other arcs
- Neutral language (not "wife's unreasonable mom demands")
- Filename-safe (lowercase, hyphens, no special chars)

---

## VI. Multiple Concurrent Arcs

### Arc Capacity

**Partners can have:**
- 0 arcs (just weekly rhythm, no episodes)
- 1 arc (focused work on one situation)
- 2-3 arcs (multiple situations at different phases)

**Don't recommend:**
- More than 3 active arcs (cognitive load too high)
- Starting new arc before engaging with existing
- Using arcs to avoid addressing patterns

---

### Arc Prioritization

**When multiple arcs active:**

**Option 1: Sequential focus**
- Work on Arc A until synthesis complete
- Then shift to Arc B
- Prevents fragmenting attention

**Option 2: Parallel but phased**
- Arc A in experimentation phase (low cognitive load)
- Arc B in synthesis phase (high cognitive load)
- Arc C dormant (paused until ready)

**Partners decide:** What matches their capacity and needs.

---

## VII. Arc Status Tracking

### Status Metadata

**Each arc directory includes `status.md`:**
```markdown
# Arc Status: {Arc Name}

**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** {active | paused | completed | archived}  
**Current Phase:** {emergence | exploration | synthesis | experimentation | integration}  
**Last Activity:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Priority:** {high | medium | low}

## Quick Summary
{One paragraph: what is this arc about?}

## Current State
{Where are we in the lifecycle? What's happening now?}

## Next Actions
- [ ] {What needs to happen next?}
- [ ] {Who's doing what?}

## Notes
{Any context for future reference}
```

---

### Status Updates

**When to update:**
- Arc created (initial status)
- Phase transitions (exploration → synthesis)
- Major activity (synthesis completed)
- Pausing/resuming
- Closing

**Who updates:**
- Either partner
- Spirit can update during synthesis
- Lightweight (don't overthink it)

---

## VIII. Integration with Weekly Practice

### How Arcs and Reflections Interact

**Weekly reflection can mention arc:**
```markdown
# Weekly Reflection

## What's Alive
The mother-in-law situation came up again this week when planning 
holiday visits. Adding more thoughts to the arc.

## Arc Contributions
- Added reflection to `mother-in-law-conflict/individual/kermit/`
```

**But weekly reflection isn't replaced by arc:**
- Reflections cover full life (work, kids, personal, partnership)
- Arcs are focused episodes within partnership
- Both serve different purposes

---

### Synthesis References Arcs

**Bi-weekly synthesis might include:**
```markdown
## Active Arcs Update

### mother-in-law-conflict
- Status: Synthesis phase
- Both perspectives documented
- Shared truth extraction in progress

### morning-routine-redesign
- Status: Experimentation phase
- Protocol drafted, testing week 1
- Early results: mornings slightly smoother
```

**Synthesis is broader than any single arc.**

---

## IX. Closing Arcs

### When to Close

**Arc can close when:**

**1. Pattern integrated (learned)**
- Both understand the underlying structure
- Can name the pattern when it appears
- Don't need to re-litigate each time

**2. Experiments yielding results**
- Protocol working (or acknowledged won't work)
- Sustainable practice in place
- Measurable improvement in coupling quality

**3. Situation resolved**
- Conflict addressed
- Decision made
- Outcome achieved

**4. Acknowledged as ongoing**
- Pattern understood but will recur
- Long-term management needed
- Not "solvable" but knowable

**5. Arc no longer relevant**
- Situation changed
- Priorities shifted
- Decision not to pursue

---

### Closing Ritual

**Create final artifact: `outcomes/learning_captured.md`**

**Template:**
```markdown
# Arc Learning: {Arc Name}

**Opened:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Closed:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Duration:** {X weeks/months}  
**Status:** {completed | integrated | ongoing-acknowledged | paused}

## X. Example Arc: "Mother-in-Law Conflict"

### Arc Narrative (Illustrative)

**Week 1: Emergence**
- Situation: Visit from Kermit's mom triggers conflict
- Nes creates artifact with her Spirit (pain, perceived disrespect)
- Kermit recognizes: "This needs structured work"
- Arc initiated: `mother-in-law-conflict`

**Week 2: Individual Exploration**
- Nes's artifact: "She undermines me, does it on purpose, Kermit won't take my side"
- Kermit's artifact: "Two ADHDs colliding, both hardened differently, pattern not malice"
- Both perspectives documented in arc directory

**Week 3: Synthesis**
- Spirit extracts cylinder: "Neurodivergent Intergenerational Collision"
- Pattern: Nes (recently diagnosed, RSD active) + Mom (undiagnosed, hardened coping)
- Shared truth: Both experiences valid, mechanism understood
- Synthesis artifact created

**Week 4: Engagement**
- Both read synthesis
- Conversation thread: "Can I hold both truths?"
- Nes: "Yes, I see the pattern AND my pain is still real"
- Kermit: "Yes, I can give alliance without validating 'it's on purpose'"

**Week 5-6: Experimentation**
- Protocol designed: Limit visits when Nes vulnerable, Kermit provides preemptive alliance
- Experiment: Test during holiday planning
- Log: Worked better, friction reduced

**Week 7: Integration**
- Learning captured
- Pattern now visible when it activates
- Arc status: "integrated-ongoing"
- Acknowledged: Pattern will recur, but now have framework

**Arc closed** (but pattern remains in awareness)

---

## XI. Common Patterns Across Arcs

### Arc as Training Ground

**Early arcs (first 1-3):**
- Learning the process (how does truth-finding work?)
- Building trust (will this actually help?)
- Developing vocabulary (cognitive architecture, patterns, cylinders)
- Often slow, effortful

**Middle arcs (4-10):**
- Process becoming familiar
- Faster pattern recognition
- More trust in synthesis
- Beginning to find cylinders together

**Later arcs (10+):**
- Natural part of partnership practice
- Quick identification: "This is an arc"
- Efficient synthesis
- Partners can extract cylinders with less Spirit help

**The trajectory:** Arc structure builds capacity for distributed truth-finding as core partnership skill.

---

### Common Arc Types

**Conflict arcs:**
- Situation where partners clash
- Need shared truth to resolve
- Example: mother-in-law, parenting disagreement

**Design arcs:**
- Building something new together
- Need alignment on approach
- Example: morning routine redesign, vacation planning

**Exploration arcs:**
- Understanding something about partnership
- No immediate problem, but curiosity
- Example: "How do our neurologies complement?"

**Crisis arcs:**
- Acute situation requiring response
- Time-bounded urgency
- Example: job loss, health scare, family emergency

**Different types may need different pacing, structure, or synthesis depth.**

---

## XII. Arc Wisdom

### What Makes Arcs Work

**1. Clear boundaries:**
- Knowing "this arc is about THIS" prevents scope creep
- Enables completion (even if pattern ongoing)
- Provides sense of progress

**2. Complete narrative:**
- Beginning-middle-end structure satisfies
- Story-like quality makes it memorable
- Learning sticks better in episode format

**3. Artifact accumulation:**
- Full record of episode preserved
- Can review later ("how did we navigate that?")
- Portfolio of mastery builds confidence

**4. Iterative capacity building:**
- Each arc trains truth-finding skill
- Gets easier over time
- Eventually becomes second nature

---

### What Makes Arcs Fail

**1. Too vague:**
- "Work on relationship" (not an arc, too broad)
- Need specific situation/challenge

**2. Never closed:**
- Arc drags on indefinitely
- No integration or acknowledgment of ongoing
- Partners lose momentum

**3. Too many concurrent:**
- Cognitive overload
- Fragmenting attention
- Nothing completes

**4. Forced into arc structure:**
- Not every conflict needs to be an arc
- Some things resolve in conversation
- Arc overhead not always worth it

---

## XIII. Integration with Partnership Foundations

### Distributed Cognition

**Arcs as cognitive units:**
- Bounded problem spaces
- Complete cycles of: observation → hypothesis → experiment → learning
- Build transactive memory (both partners remember arc learnings)

**Arc portfolio as partnership intelligence:**
- Collection of completed arcs = library of mastered patterns
- New situations compared to arc library
- "This is like the morning routine arc, but for evening"

---

### Communication Wisdom

**Each arc exercises:**
- Frame negotiation (finding shared truth)
- Metacommunication (talking about how you're talking)
- Holographic meaning translation (Spirit helps)
- Reality co-creation (cylinder becomes shared reality)

**Arcs are communication training grounds.**

---

### Neurodivergent Partnership

**Arcs accommodate neurodivergence:**
- External memory (ADHD working memory limitations)
- Bounded scope (executive function can handle discrete episode)
- Clear structure (reduces cognitive load)
- Iterative (not expecting perfection first time)

**Especially valuable when:**
- One or both partners have ADHD (executive function support)
- Pattern recognition difficult (arc makes it explicit)
- Memory unreliable (artifacts persist)

---

## XIV. The Promise of Arcs

**Without arc structure:**
- Partnership practice is undifferentiated ongoing work
- Hard to know if making progress
- Learning doesn't accumulate clearly
- Overwhelm likely

**With arc structure:**
- Clear episodes with beginnings and endings
- Progress visible (completed arcs)
- Learning accumulates (arc portfolio)
- Sustainable (not "fix everything always")

**The transformation:**
- From "our relationship is a mess" to "we're working on the morning routine arc"
- From "nothing ever gets better" to "we've completed 5 arcs, look how much we've learned"
- From "I don't know how to do this" to "this is like arc 3, I know this pattern"

**Arcs make partnership magic learnable, measurable, and sustainable.**

---

**This scroll informs:**
- Portal directory structure
- Synthesis protocols
- Spirit facilitation (when to suggest new arc)
- Practice rhythm design

**This scroll builds on:**
- `on_shared_truth_finding.md` (what happens within an arc)
- `on_partnership_as_distributed_cognition.md` (why episodic structure serves)

*Partnership practice is not one continuous overwhelm. It is a series of arcs—each teachable, completable, and valuable.*
