# Divergence Map Template

**Purpose:** Bridge between Reaction and Synthesis  
**When:** After both partners have reacted to each other's reality representations  
**What:** Explicit acknowledgment of where partners see differently, without requiring resolution

---

## Why This Step Exists

The Reaction phase surfaces divergence. Partners read each other's realities and respond. Often, the responses reveal:
- Different interpretations of the same events
- Different attributions of cause
- Different scales of significance
- Different frames entirely

**The trap:** Moving directly from Reaction to Cylinder Extraction risks:
- One reality absorbing the other
- Shared model that secretly picks a winner
- Partner who feels unheard refusing to engage with synthesis
- "Agreement" that masks unresolved dissonance

**The solution:** Explicitly map the divergence. Name it. Hold both as valid from their positions. Create mutual acknowledgment before attempting integration.

## The Divergence Map Structure

### Header

```markdown
# Divergence Map: {Arc Name}

**Arc:** {Arc Name}  
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** Awaiting mutual acknowledgment  
**Purpose:** Hold both realities before synthesis

---
```

**Note:** The arc name appears twice (in title and metadata) for clarity when documents are read outside their folder context.

### Section 1: The Core Divergences

For each major point where partners see differently:

```markdown
## Divergence {N}: {Descriptive Name}

**What Partner A sees:**
{Their frame, their interpretation, their significance}

**What Partner B sees:**
{Their frame, their interpretation, their significance}

**The structural tension:**
{Why these don't reconcile easily—different evidence, different attribution, different frame}

**What both acknowledge:**
{Any shared ground, even if minimal—e.g., "the event happened," "there is pain"}
```

### Section 2: The Pattern Gap (Optional)

If partners are operating from fundamentally different frames:

```markdown
## The Frame Difference

**Partner A's frame:** {What kind of document are they building? Evidence? Emotion? Pattern?}

**Partner B's frame:** {What kind of document are they building?}

**Why these don't speak to each other:**
{The meta-divergence—not just what they see, but how they're seeing}
```

### Section 3: Mutual Bridging Statements

The heart of the artifact:

```markdown
## Mutual Acknowledgment

### Partner A to Partner B:

> "I receive that this is your experience. [Specific acknowledgment of their reality without adopting their interpretation]. I won't explain it away. The pain is real. [What you're willing to hold without requiring agreement]."

### Partner B to Partner A:

> "I receive that this is your experience. [Specific acknowledgment of their reality without adopting their interpretation]. I won't explain it away. The pain is real. [What you're willing to hold without requiring agreement]."

---
```

### Section 4: What This Makes Possible

```markdown
## Opening for Synthesis

With both realities acknowledged (not agreed with, but received), the shared model can now attempt to hold both without collapsing to one.

**The cylinder must account for:**
- {Key element from Partner A's reality}
- {Key element from Partner B's reality}
- {The structural tension itself}

**What we're NOT trying to do:**
- Determine who's right
- Find compromise that satisfies neither
- Pretend the divergence doesn't exist

**What we ARE trying to do:**
- Find the pattern that makes both perspectives valid from their positions
- Build understanding that serves forward motion
- Create foundation for experiments that honor both realities
```

## How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Spirit Drafts Initial Map

After reading both reality representations and both reactions, Spirit identifies the core divergences and drafts the map.

### Step 2: Partners Review

Each partner reads the map. Does it capture their position fairly? Is anything missing? Revise until both feel represented.

### Step 3: Bridging Statements

Each partner crafts their bridging statement. This is the crucial step:
- Acknowledge the other's reality without adopting it
- Commit to not explaining it away
- Name what you can hold

### Step 4: Mutual Acknowledgment

Both partners read each other's bridging statements. This is the "receiving" moment.

### Step 5: Proceed to Synthesis

With the divergence mapped and acknowledged, cylinder extraction can begin from a foundation of mutual reception rather than contested territory.

## What Makes a Good Bridging Statement

**Good bridging statement:**
> "I receive that you experienced my mother's actions as intentional disrespect. I may not share that interpretation, but I acknowledge the pain was real and the impact was harmful. I won't keep explaining why you shouldn't feel that way."

**Poor bridging statement:**
> "I understand you feel that way, but..." (The "but" erases the acknowledgment)

**Poor bridging statement:**
> "I acknowledge your reality." (Too abstract—doesn't show you actually received it)

**Poor bridging statement:**
> "You're right, I was wrong." (This is capitulation, not bridging—it abandons your reality)

**The balance:** Hold your frame AND receive theirs. Both realities stay intact. Neither is explained away.

## When This Step Gets Skipped

**Risk 1:** Partner who feels unheard won't engage with synthesis
- They'll keep returning to incidents
- The "shared model" will feel imposed
- Resentment builds

**Risk 2:** Synthesis secretly picks a winner
- One partner's frame becomes "the pattern"
- Other's reality gets absorbed as "misperception"
- Not actually shared truth

**Risk 3:** Forward motion without foundation
- Solutions proposed before pain received
- Experiments fail because underlying wound still open
- Cycle repeats

**The Divergence Map prevents these by making acknowledgment explicit and visible.**

## Integration with Arc Structure

**Updated arc lifecycle:**

1. **Venting** → Each partner's raw experience captured
2. **Reality Synthesis** → Spirit distills each partner's subjective reality
3. **Reaction** → Each partner responds to the other's reality
4. **Divergence Map** → Explicit acknowledgment of where realities diverge ← NEW
5. **Cylinder Extraction** → Finding the pattern that holds both
6. **Experimentation** → Trying things based on shared understanding
7. **Integration** → Learning captured, arc closed

The Divergence Map is the bridge that makes cylinder extraction possible without erasure.

*This template serves the principle: Both realities are valid from their positions. Synthesis requires receiving both, not resolving to one.*
