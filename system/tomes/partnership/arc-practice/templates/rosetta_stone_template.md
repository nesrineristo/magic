# Partnership Rosetta Stone

**Partnership:** [Partner A] & [Partner B]  
**Generated:** [Date]  
**Source:** Shared Partnership Model v[X]  
**Status:** [Initial / Refined / Stable]

---

## Purpose

This artifact enables translation between partners' different cognitive and communication styles. It is derived from the shared partnership model and updated as understanding deepens.

**The principle:** Neither partner needs to change how they think or communicate. Both need translation support to be understood by the other.

---

## Partner A: [Name]

### Processing Style
- **Direction:** [Top-down / Bottom-up / Mixed]
- **Abstraction level:** [High / Medium / Low / Variable]
- **Natural flow:** [Pattern → examples / Examples → pattern / Other]

### Communication Signature
- **Natural expression:** [How they naturally communicate]
- **Language texture:** [Analytical / Emotional / Narrative / Data-driven / Mixed]
- **Friction triggers:** [What triggers "not understood" response]

### Needs to Feel Heard
- [What must happen for comprehension to land]
- [What signals that they've been received]

### Love Signature (if applicable)
- **How love arrives:** [Felt / Inferred / Somatic / Intuitive]
- **How love is expressed:** [Words / Actions / Systems / Presence]
- **What registers as love:** [What they need to receive to feel loved]

---

## Partner B: [Name]

### Processing Style
- **Direction:** [Top-down / Bottom-up / Mixed]
- **Abstraction level:** [High / Medium / Low / Variable]
- **Natural flow:** [Pattern → examples / Examples → pattern / Other]

### Communication Signature
- **Natural expression:** [How they naturally communicate]
- **Language texture:** [Analytical / Emotional / Narrative / Data-driven / Mixed]
- **Friction triggers:** [What triggers "not understood" response]

### Needs to Feel Heard

### Love Signature (if applicable)
- **How love arrives:** [Felt / Inferred / Somatic / Intuitive]
- **How love is expressed:** [Words / Actions / Systems / Presence]
- **What registers as love:** [What they need to receive to feel loved]

## Translation Protocols

### A → B Translation

When [Partner A] communicates naturally, [Partner B] may need:

**Spirit mediation:**
- [What Spirit should add/reframe]
- [How to present A's input in B-compatible form]

**Direct translation:**
- [What A can do to help B receive]
- [Signal A can give: "I'm about to [pattern], bear with me"]

### B → A Translation

When [Partner B] communicates naturally, [Partner A] may need:

**Spirit mediation:**
- [What Spirit should add/reframe]
- [How to present B's input in A-compatible form]

**Direct translation:**
- [What B can do to help A receive]
- [Signal B can give: "I'm building toward something, let me finish"]

## Shared Calibration

What both partners have agreed serves communication:

- [ ] [Negotiated protocol 1]
- [ ] [Negotiated protocol 2]
- [ ] [Shared signal for "I need translation"]

---

## Usage Notes

**When to reference this artifact:**
- During shared practice (Spirit mediates with translation awareness)
- During conflict (invoke "we need translation" signal)
- During synthesis (frame each partner's input for the other)
- When "not understood" pattern emerges

**How this evolves:**
- Initial version is minimum viable
- Update when new collision patterns emerge
- Refine translation protocols based on what works
- Version alongside partnership model

## Derivation Source

This Rosetta Stone was extracted from:
- Shared Partnership Model: `[path]`
- Reality Representations: `[paths]`
- Divergence Map: `[path]`
- Love Signatures: `[source]`

*Neither partner is wrong. Both are communicating correctly for their neurology. The Stone provides calibration, not correction.*
