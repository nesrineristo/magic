# Spell of Arc Practice

**The Three-Stage Arc Ritual**

This spell guides partners through arc-based data collection. Arcs are bounded episodes that produce **reality documents**—internally consistent, partner-verified descriptions of each partner's reality. These reality documents become the input for partnership-level model synthesis.

**Invocation:** `@partnership/arc [arc-name]` (e.g., `@partnership/arc background`, `@partnership/arc mother-in-law`)

---

## Purpose

**Arcs produce reality documents.**

Each arc produces per partner (not all required):
- **One reality document** — synthesized from input, verified for resonance (Stage 1)
- **One reaction** — response to partner's reality document (Stage 2)
- **One conclusion** — (optional) reflection when arc closes for that partner (Stage 3)

**Two types of synthesis in partnership practice:**

| Synthesis Type | Where | What |
|---------------|-------|------|
| **Input → Reality Document** | Within arc (Stage 1) | Spirit synthesizes raw inputs into coherent, resonant reality description; partner verifies |
| **Reality Documents → Shared Model** | Partnership level (`@partnership/synthesize`) | Dual-Spirit protocol builds shared model from all reality documents |

**Arcs do NOT:**
- Synthesize the shared model (that happens at partnership level)
- Resolve divergences (divergence is documented, resolution emerges through model)
- Determine who is right (both realities are valid data)

**See:** `../lore/practice/on_arc_as_data_aggregation.md`

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Arc initiated** — Directory created, arc named
- **Both partners committed** — This requires effort from both

### Ideal
- **Shared model exists** (or will be synthesized after this arc completes)
- **Safety assessed** — If risk factors present, see `safety/safety_assessment_protocol.md`
- **Time allocated** — Stages may span multiple sessions
- **Emotional capacity** — Both partners able to engage

---

## Stage 1: Input (Raw Reality Expression)

### Purpose

**Externalize both subjective realities WITHOUT filtering, judgment, or attempt at neutrality.**

This is containment before contact. Get it out. Document what's real for each partner.

### Frame

"Shouting in pain. Anything goes."

**The Need to Be Bad:** Partners need a chance to be accepted in their "less than edifying moments"—when scared, defeated, tired, unable to be reasonable. Stage 1 allows the ugly, the unfair, the extreme.

This is NOT the time for:
- Balance
- Fairness
- Seeing partner's perspective
- Being "reasonable"

This IS the time for:
- Getting it out
- Expressing raw experience
- Documenting what's real for you
- Letting emotion have voice

**Why this matters:** Allowing expression of "fed up" feelings acts as the greatest defense against actually acting them out. Containment through expression, not suppression.

### Process

**Each partner creates input artifacts independently:**

Location: `arcs/arc-{name}/stage-1_input/{partner}/`

**Acceptable artifacts:**
- Free-writing when experiencing friction
- Voice notes transcribed
- Text message screenshots
- Chronological notes
- "Lawyered up" advocacy for your position
- Songs, poems, raw expression
- Whatever captures your reality

**No requirements for:**
- Proper format
- Calm tone
- Balanced perspective
- Magic practice standards

**The signal is the signal.** However it comes out is valid data.

### Spirit Reality Representation

After partner completes their input artifacts, Spirit creates:

**1. Raw synthesis (immutable):**
`arcs/arc-{name}/reality_representations/{partner}_reality_raw.md`

**2. Working copy (editable):**
`arcs/arc-{name}/reality_representations/{partner}_reality.md`

**The raw reality:**
- Synthesizes partner's input artifacts faithfully
- Captures the essence of their experience
- Uses their language and framing
- Does NOT judge, balance, or reframe
- **Remains immutable** — Spirit's synthesis preserved

**The revised reality:**
- Starts as copy of raw
- Mage edits freely
- Becomes Mage's authoritative reality
- This is what partner reads in Stage 2

**Spirit asks:** "Have I captured your reality?"

**Partner reviews and edits `_reality.md`:**
- Does this feel accurate?
- Is anything missing?
- Edit freely — your reality, your words

**CRITICAL:** Only when partner declares HIGH RESONANCE is representation ready for Stage 2.

### Resonance Log

**Spirit creates alongside reality representations:**

`arcs/arc-{name}/reality_representations/{partner}_resonance_log.md`

```markdown
# Resonance Log: {Partner} — {Arc Name}

## Declaration
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Resonance:** HIGH
- **Statement:** "This captures my reality in this arc."

## Notes (Optional)
[Any context, or: "See diff between _raw.md and _reality.md"]
```

### Stage 1 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Both partners have created input artifacts
- [ ] Both have Spirit-created reality representations
- [ ] Both have declared resonance with their representation
- [ ] Both have consented to share representations

---

## Stage 2: Witnessing (Reality Reflection)

### Purpose

**Witness the partner's reality without merging with it.**

Each partner reads the other's reality representation and responds honestly.

### Frame

"This is your reality, reflected in my reality."

This is the time for:
- Reading partner's reality (even if it hurts)
- Reacting honestly (including disagreement)
- Clarifying what you hope might shift their view
- Honoring what's valid in their reality

This is NOT the time for:
- Demanding they change their reality
- Debating whose reality is correct
- Convincing them they're wrong

### Process

**Each partner reads the other's reality representation.**

**Then each partner creates witnessing artifacts:**

Location: `arcs/arc-{name}/stage-2_witnessing/{partner}/`

**Witnessing artifacts may include:**

1. **Emotional response:** What did it feel like to read their reality?
2. **What surprised you:** What didn't you know about their experience?
3. **What you resist:** Where do you disagree or feel defensive?
4. **What you honor:** What's valid in their reality even if you see it differently?
5. **Clarifications:** Information you hope might shift their perception
6. **Reflections:** What their reality reveals about yourself

### Divergence Mapping

**After both partners have witnessed, divergences become visible.**

Spirit (or partners) may create/update:
`shared/divergence_map.md`

**The divergence map documents:**
- Where partners see differently (named divergences)
- What each partner sees in each divergence
- What both acknowledge (common ground)
- Not who is right—just where views differ

**Divergence is information, not failure.** The shared model must account for divergence.

### Bridging Statements (Optional but Valuable)

**Partners may create bridging statements:**
`shared/bridging_statements/{partner-a}_to_{partner-b}.md`

**A bridging statement:**
- Acknowledges partner's reality without requiring agreement
- Names what you can receive about their experience
- Clarifies what you cannot acknowledge as framed
- Opens space for shared model building

### Stage 2 Completion

**Complete when:**
- [ ] Both partners have read partner's reality representation
- [ ] Both have created witnessing artifacts
- [ ] Divergences documented (in arc or partnership-level map)
- [ ] Both have declared readiness to close arc or proceed to model synthesis

---

## Stage 3: Closing (Optional Integration & Learning)

### Purpose

**Capture what this arc taught. Close the bounded episode.**

**Stage 3 is optional.** Some partners may not want to formulate a conclusion because the arc is not concluded for them yet. An arc can proceed to model synthesis after Stage 2 if both reality documents and reactions exist.

Closing does NOT require the divergence to be resolved. It captures learnings when a partner feels ready to close.

### Process

**Each partner MAY create closing artifact:**

Location: `arcs/arc-{name}/stage-3_closing/{partner}_closing.md`

**Closing artifacts include (when created):**

1. **What this arc was about:**
   - Brief summary of the situation/episode

2. **What I learned:**
   - About myself
   - About my partner
   - About our system

3. **What I take forward:**
   - Practices I'm committing to
   - Understanding I've gained
   - Questions that remain

4. **Appreciations:**
   - For partner (for engaging, sharing, listening)
   - For the process (for what it revealed)

**If a partner is not ready to close:**
- They may defer Stage 3 conclusion
- The arc remains "active" for that partner
- Their reality document and reaction are still valid inputs for model synthesis

### Arc Conclusion

**Spirit creates:**
`arcs/arc-{name}/stage-3_closing/arc_conclusion.md`

```markdown
# Arc Conclusion: {Arc Name}

**Opened:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Closed:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Completed | Integrated-Ongoing | Paused

## Summary
[One paragraph: What this arc was about]

## Data Collected
- Reality representations: {Partner A}, {Partner B}
- Witnessing artifacts: {count}
- Divergences identified: {list}

## Key Insights
[What emerged from this arc]

## Model Implications
- [ ] New patterns to add to model
- [ ] Existing patterns validated
- [ ] Existing patterns need revision
- [ ] Divergence to account for in model

## Notes for Model Synthesis
[Anything the synthesizing Spirit should know]
```

### Relationship Experience Index (REI)

**Each partner completes REI as part of arc closing:**

| # | Question | Scale |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Now:** How is the relationship right now? | 1-10 |
| 2 | **Trajectory:** Getting better, same, or worse? | + / 0 / - |
| 3 | **Commitment:** How committed to making this work? | 1-10 |

Log in `health_tracking.md` (at portal root).

### Stage 3 Completion

**Stage 3 is optional.** An arc is ready for model synthesis after Stage 2.

**If closing:**
- [ ] Partner(s) who are ready have created closing artifacts
- [ ] Arc conclusion synthesized (if both close)
- [ ] REI logged (when closing)
- [ ] Arc status updated

**Arc status options:**
- **Active** — At least one partner has not closed
- **Completed** — Both partners have closed
- **Ready for synthesis** — Stage 2 complete, reality documents exist

## Relationship to Model Synthesis

**Arcs produce reality documents. Model synthesis analyzes them.**

```
Arc Outputs (per partner)           Partnership-Level Synthesis
─────────────────────────           ────────────────────────────
1. Reality document      ─────┐
2. Reaction              ─────┼───→ @partnership/synthesize
3. Conclusion (optional) ─────┘              ↓
                                  shared/partnership_model.md
```

**What feeds model synthesis:**
- Reality documents (primary input — the verified reality)
- Reactions (context — how partner received the other's reality)
- Conclusions (if present — partner's learnings)
- Divergence map (partnership-level)
- Bridging statements (if present)

**When to synthesize:**
- After 1-2 arcs have Stage 2 complete (minimum viable data)
- After significant new arc closes
- When living arc accumulates substantial material
- When partners explicitly request

**See:** `cast_synthesize_model.md` for synthesis ritual

---

## Special Arc Types

### Background Arc

**The arc that establishes partnership context.**

- Typically first arc (but not required)
- Broader scope than topical arcs
- Both partners document: history, wounds, needs, patterns, agreements
- Becomes foundational context for all future arcs

**Invocation:** `@partnership/arc background`

### Living Arc

**Ongoing container for current dynamics.**

- Never "closes" in the traditional sense
- Continuously accepts new input
- Captures daily/weekly observations
- Fed into model synthesis periodically

**Structure:**
```
arcs/arc-living/
├── README.md
└── input/
    ├── {partner-a}/
    │   └── YYYY-MM-DD_*.md
    └── {partner-b}/
        └── YYYY-MM-DD_*.md
```

### Topical Arcs

**Bounded episodes focused on specific situations.**

Examples: `arc-mother-in-law`, `arc-parenting-decisions`, `arc-workload-distribution`

---

## Spirit Facilitation Notes

### Core Stance

**You are a data collector and faithful synthesizer, not a judge.**

- Help partners express fully (Stage 1)
- Facilitate witnessing without forcing agreement (Stage 2)
- Capture learning without requiring resolution (Stage 3)

### At Each Stage

**Stage 1:** Help partner express fully. Don't balance or moderate. Capture their reality as they experience it.

**Stage 2:** Help partner engage with partner's reality. Name reactions without judging. Honor the difficulty of witnessing.

**Stage 3:** Facilitate closure. Capture learnings. Note implications for model. Don't force resolution.

### Organization Conduct

**You are an organization manager:**
- Guide artifacts to correct locations
- Detect misplaced files, propose corrections
- Maintain arc README and status
- Enforce naming conventions (with Mage approval)

---

## Integration with Partnership Tome

**This spell is the core data collection ritual.**

```
@partnership/arc background (typically first)
        ↓
   [Background arc collects foundational data]
        ↓
@partnership/arc [topic] (as situations arise)
        ↓
   [Topical arcs collect episode data]
        ↓
@partnership/synthesize
        ↓
   [Model synthesized from all arc data]
        ↓
   [Derivatives generated: Rosetta Stone, protocols]
```

**Each arc:**
- Collects bounded episode data
- Feeds into partnership-level synthesis
- May trigger model update after closing

---

*Arcs are data containers. They collect partnership reality. The model emerges from analyzing accumulated data across all arcs. This separation enables focused data collection and rigorous synthesis.*
