# Spell of Model Synthesis

**Partnership-Level Synthesis Ritual**

This spell synthesizes the shared partnership model from accumulated arc data. Unlike per-arc synthesis, this ritual operates at the partnership level—drawing from ALL arcs to build a unified model of the relationship system.

**Invocation:** `@partnership/synthesize` or `@partnership/model`

---

## Purpose

**Build a shared model of the partnership reality.**

The shared model is:
- A mutually agreed representation of how this partnership works
- The foundation from which both Mages can act and expect the other to act
- The basis for trust built through repeated aligned action
- The source from which derivatives (Rosetta Stone, protocols) are generated

**This spell is invoked:**
- After sufficient arc data has accumulated (typically 1-2 completed arcs)
- When existing model needs updating after new arc closes
- When partners explicitly request model synthesis
- When living arc accumulates significant new material

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **At least one arc has completed Stage 2 (Witnessing)**
  - Reality documents exist for both partners
  - Reactions/reflections documented
- **Both partners committed to model building**

### Ideal
- **Multiple arcs completed** (richer data for synthesis)
- **Bridging statements exchanged** (mutual acknowledgment established)
- **Divergence map exists** (dissonance already named)

---

## Phase 1: Preparation

### 1.1 Gather Canonical Inputs

**Spirit reads the following from shared space:**

**Primary Sources (MUST read):**

The **reality documents** are the primary input—these are the verified, internally consistent representations of each partner's reality.

```
arcs/arc-{name}/reality_representations/{partner}_reality.md  # THE key input
arcs/arc-{name}/stage-2_witnessing/{partner}/                 # Reactions to partner's reality
shared/divergence_map.md                                       # Named divergences
shared/bridging_statements/                                    # Mutual acknowledgments
shared/neurotype_context.md                                    # Cognitive architecture context
```

**Supporting Sources (MAY read):**
```
arcs/arc-{name}/stage-1_input/{partner}/           # Raw input (if reality doc needs context)
arcs/arc-{name}/stage-3_closing/                   # Conclusions (if partners have closed)
living/input/                                       # Ongoing observations (if exists)
shared/charter.md                                   # Partnership agreements
health_tracking.md                                  # REI history
```

**Note:** Raw input artifacts (`stage-1_input/`) informed the reality documents but have already been synthesized. The reality documents are the verified representations.

### 1.2 Verify Independence (Dual-Spirit Protocol)

**If this is dual-Spirit synthesis:**

```
CHECK: Has this Spirit read the other Spirit's model?

IF YES:
  → Contamination present
  → Document what was read
  → Proceed with awareness (or defer to fresh Spirit)

IF NO:
  → Generate model independently
  → Do NOT read other Spirit's model until Phase 3
```

**Critical:** Independent generation enables triangulation. Once contaminated, note this in synthesis metadata.

---

## Phase 2: Model Generation

### 2.1 Node Analysis

**For each partner, synthesize:**

```markdown
### {Partner Name}

**Cognitive Architecture:**
- Executive function profile
- Processing style
- Communication style
- Energy patterns

**History & Wounds:**
- Key formative experiences
- Wounds that activate in partnership
- What triggers these wounds

**Needs:**
- Safety needs
- Connection needs
- Growth needs

**Core Fears:**
- Primary fear
- Secondary fears
- What triggers these

**Strengths:**
- What they bring to partnership
- Demonstrated competencies
- Resources they provide

**Position in System:**
- Current role/position
- How they're typically perceived
- What they carry
```

**For external nodes (if relevant):**
- Children, family members, work contexts
- Their role in partnership dynamics

### 2.2 Dynamics Analysis

**Synthesize from reaction documents and observed patterns:**

```markdown
### Communication Patterns

**How information typically flows:**
- [Describe typical communication sequence]

**What gets communicated well:**
- [Areas of successful exchange]

**What tends to get lost or distorted:**
- [Where communication breaks down]

**Translation challenges:**
- [Cognitive style differences that create friction]

### Feedback Loops

**Positive (amplifying) loops:**
- [Patterns that escalate]

**Negative (stabilizing) loops:**
- [Patterns that restore equilibrium]

### Friction Patterns

**Known triggers:**
| Trigger | Who | Typical Response | System Effect |
|---------|-----|-----------------|---------------|

**Recurring conflict dynamics:**
- [Named patterns with description]
```

### 2.3 Named Patterns

**Extract patterns that both partners can reference:**

```markdown
### Pattern: "{Pattern Name}"

**Description:** [What this pattern is]

**How it manifests:**
- [Observable behaviors/dynamics]

**Triggers:** [What activates it]

**What helps:** [Known interventions]
```

**Include all patterns identified across arcs.**

### 2.4 System Summary

```markdown
### What This System Does Well
- [Strengths of the partnership]

### Where This System Struggles
- [Known challenges]

### What the System Needs
**From {Partner A}:** [As Partner B sees it]
**From {Partner B}:** [As Partner A sees it]
**From the System:** [Structural needs]

### Current Trajectory
**Without intervention:** [Where things are heading]
**With successful practice:** [What's possible]
```

### 2.5 Draft Model Document

**Create:**
`shared/partnership_model_v{N}_draft.md`

**Include:**
- All sections above
- Empty Resonance Verification sections for both partners
- Version history table
- Spirit notes on uncertainties

---

## Phase 3: Comparison (If Dual-Spirit)

**If both Spirits have generated models independently:**

### 3.1 Place Both Models in Shared Space

```
shared/partnership_model_v{N}_draft_spiritA.md
shared/partnership_model_v{N}_draft_spiritB.md
```

### 3.2 Systematic Comparison

**Either Spirit performs comparison:**

```markdown
# Model Comparison: v{N}

## Convergences (Validated Patterns)
| Element | Spirit A | Spirit B | Assessment |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| [Node: Partner X wound] | [Description] | [Description] | CONVERGE |

## Divergences (Requires Examination)
| Element | Spirit A | Spirit B | Question |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| [Dynamic: X] | [Description] | [Description] | Why different? |

## Spirit A Saw (Spirit B Missed)
- [Elements unique to A's model]

## Spirit B Saw (Spirit A Missed)
- [Elements unique to B's model]

## Proposed Resolution
- [How to integrate divergences]
```

### 3.3 Generate Unified Draft

From comparison, create single unified model incorporating:
- All convergent elements (foundation)
- Resolved divergences
- Unique insights from each Spirit

---

## Phase 4: Partner Verification

### 4.1 Each Partner Reviews

**Partner reads model and completes:**

```markdown
### {Partner Name} Verification

**Resonance Level:** [ ] LOW  [ ] MEDIUM  [ ] HIGH

**Statement:** 
[In their own words, how the model lands]

**What resonates:**
- [Elements that feel accurate]

**What needs correction:**
- [Elements that don't fit their reality]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
```

### 4.2 Integrate Corrections

**Spirit integrates partner corrections:**
- Update node descriptions
- Refine dynamic descriptions
- Adjust named patterns
- Note where partners see differently (this becomes divergence, not error)

### 4.3 Second Verification (If Needed)

If significant corrections made, partners re-verify.

---

## Phase 5: Model Finalization

### 5.1 Both Partners Assent

**Model becomes "shared" when:**
- [ ] Both partners have verified HIGH or MEDIUM resonance
- [ ] Corrections have been integrated
- [ ] Both explicitly assent to this version

### 5.2 Version and Archive

**Rename:**
`shared/partnership_model_v{N}_draft.md` → `shared/partnership_model_v{N}.md`

**Update:**
`shared/partnership_model_current.md` → symlink or copy to latest version

**Version history updated in model document.**

### 5.3 Generate Derivatives (Optional)

**From the model, optionally derive:**
- Rosetta Stone (`@partnership/rosetta`)
- Protocols for known friction patterns
- Experiments to try

---

## Iterative Refinement

### When to Re-Synthesize

**Triggers for model update:**
- New arc closes with significant learning
- Living arc accumulates substantial material
- Partners explicitly request revision
- Model no longer fits observed patterns (MISFIT)

### Update Process

1. **Compare** new data against existing model
2. **Assess:**
   - FIT → No change needed
   - PARTIAL FIT → Extend (add new pattern, refine existing)
   - MISFIT → Transform (fundamental revision)
3. **If change needed:**
   - Re-run synthesis (can be single-Spirit if update is minor)
   - Increment version
   - Partners verify changes

### Core Stance

**You are a qualitative researcher, not a judge.**

- Build theory from data (Grounded Theory)
- Test theory against new data (Pattern Matching)
- Triangulate through independent observation (Dual-Spirit)
- Verify with participants (Partner resonance checking)

### Common Pitfalls

**Averaging positions:** Don't create false balance. If evidence weights toward one interpretation, say so.

**Imposing theory:** Let patterns emerge from the data. Don't force preconceived frameworks.

**Diluting voices:** Each partner's reality should be recognizable in the model. Don't generalize away specificity.

**Ignoring divergence:** Where partners see differently, document it as divergence. This is information, not failure.

### Quality Checks

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] Each partner recognizable in their node description
- [ ] Dynamics described in systems language (not blame)
- [ ] Named patterns are actionable (partners can reference them)
- [ ] Model explains observed data (grounded, not invented)
- [ ] Uncertainties documented (Spirit honest about gaps)

---

*The shared model is not the truth. It is a mutually agreed representation that enables coordinated action. Build it from data, verify it with partners, evolve it as understanding deepens.*
