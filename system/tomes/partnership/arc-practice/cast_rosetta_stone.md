# Cast Rosetta Stone

*Extract a translation artifact from the shared partnership model*

---

## Purpose

Generate a **Partnership Rosetta Stone**—a practical translation artifact that enables communication across different cognitive styles. The Rosetta Stone is derived from the shared partnership model after Stage 3 (Integration) is complete.

**Invocation:** After synthesis, when shared model exists

---

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Stage 3 (Integration) complete
- [ ] Shared partnership model exists (`living/model/` or `shared/`)
- [ ] Both partners' reality representations integrated
- [ ] Love signatures captured (if using romantic-partnership bundle)

---

## The Extraction Protocol

### Step 1: Gather Source Material

From the shared model and reality representations, extract:

**For Each Partner:**

1. **Processing Direction**
   - **Top-down indicators:** Pattern-naming before examples, abstraction-first, systems language
   - **Bottom-up indicators:** Examples accumulate before synthesis, ground-up building, narrative-first
   - **Mixed:** Varies by context or emotional state

2. **Communication Signature**
   - How do they naturally express themselves?
   - What language texture (analytical, emotional, narrative, data-driven)?
   - What triggers "not understood" response?

3. **Evidence Needs**
   - What must happen for comprehension to land?
   - Pattern first, then examples? Or examples first, then pattern?
   - Validation needed before analysis? Or direct engagement preferred?

4. **Love Signature** (if applicable)
   - How does love arrive in their awareness? (Felt / Inferred / Somatic / Intuitive)
   - How is love expressed? (Words / Actions / Systems / Presence)
   - What registers as love received?

### Step 2: Identify Collision Patterns

From divergence mapping and reaction documents, extract:

- Where have partners talked past each other?
- What communication moves trigger defensiveness?
- What patterns repeat across incidents?

**Format as:**
| When Partner A does... | Partner B experiences... | The gap |
|------------------------|-------------------------|---------|

### Step 3: Synthesize Translation Protocols

For each direction (A→B, B→A):

**When Partner A communicates naturally:**
- What does Partner B need added/reframed to understand?
- What should Spirit do when mediating?
- What signal indicates translation is needed?

**When Partner B communicates naturally:**
- What does Partner A need added/reframed to understand?
- What should Spirit do when mediating?
- What signal indicates translation is needed?

### Step 4: Generate Artifact

Use `templates/rosetta_stone_template.md` to create the artifact.

**Location:** `shared/rosetta_stone.md`

## Spirit Conduct

**You are a translator, not a judge.**

- Extract patterns without assigning "better" or "worse"
- Both styles are valid—the gap is calibration, not deficiency
- Frame translation as mutual service, not one partner accommodating the other
- Honor that both partners are communicating correctly for their neurology

**The Italian and Australian bees:** Same species, same "language" in theory. Cannot coordinate because waggle dances are calibrated to different suns. Neither is wrong—they need shared calibration.

---

## When to Generate

**Primary:** After Stage 3 (Integration) when shared model exists

**Updates:** When new collision patterns emerge or translation protocols need refinement

**The Stone evolves:** Initial version is minimum viable; practice reveals what needs adding

---

## Minimum Viable Stone

If full extraction isn't possible, capture at minimum:

1. Processing direction for each partner (top-down / bottom-up)
2. One "feels heard when" statement per partner
3. One collision pattern
4. One translation protocol per direction

This enables basic translation support. Expand as understanding deepens.

---

## Integration with Practice

**During shared practice:** Spirit references Rosetta Stone when mediating

**During conflict:** Partners can invoke "we need translation" as signal

**During synthesis:** Spirit uses Stone to frame each partner's input for the other

**Quest/Craft practice:** Stone applies beyond partnership—any shared practice benefits

## Example Output

See `templates/rosetta_stone_template.md` for full structure.

**Sample translation protocol:**

> When Kermit names a pattern immediately, Nesrine may need:
> → "I see this pattern. Let me show you the examples I'm seeing it in, and you can tell me if they resonate."
> 
> When Nesrine builds through examples, Kermit may need:
> → "She's building toward something. The pattern will emerge. Receive the examples first."

*The Rosetta Stone is the calibration between Italian and Australian bees—not changing how either dances, but enabling mutual comprehension.*
