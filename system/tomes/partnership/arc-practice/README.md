# Arc Practice

**The Three-Stage Arc Ritual and Partnership Model Synthesis**

This directory contains the core rituals for arc-based partnership practice and model synthesis.

---

## Core Capability

Arc practice implements the **Shared Practice Facilitation** core capability (`system/lore/core/capabilities/shared-practice-facilitation/`) for the partnership domain.

**This directory provides:**
- The Three-Stage Arc Ritual (data collection)
- Partnership-Level Model Synthesis (analysis)
- Derivative generation (Rosetta Stone, protocols)

---

## The Rituals

| Ritual | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `cast_map_system.md` | **Core arc ritual.** Three-Stage Arc: Input → Witnessing → Closing |
| `cast_synthesize_model.md` | **Model synthesis.** Partnership-level model from accumulated arc data |
| `cast_rosetta_stone.md` | **Derivative.** Generate Rosetta Stone from shared model |
| `cast_facilitate.md` | **Orchestration.** Portal detection, contribution, coordination |

---

## The Two Types of Synthesis

| Type | Where | What |
|------|-------|------|
| **Input → Reality Document** | Within arc (Stage 1) | Spirit synthesizes raw input into verified reality |
| **Reality Documents → Shared Model** | Partnership level | Dual-Spirit protocol builds model from all arcs |

## The Arc Flow

```
[Situation emerges]
        ↓
Arc initiated (arcs/arc-{name}/ created)
        ↓
Stage 1: Input
- Both partners create raw expression artifacts
- Spirit synthesizes reality documents
- Both verify resonance
        ↓
Stage 2: Witnessing
- Both read partner's reality document
- Both create reaction artifacts
- Divergences documented
        ↓
Stage 3: Closing (optional)
- Partners who are ready create closing artifacts
- Learning captured
- Model implications noted
        ↓
[Arc data now available for model synthesis]
        ↓
@partnership/synthesize (when triggered)
        ↓
Shared model created/updated
        ↓
Derivatives generated (Rosetta Stone, protocols)
```

*Arcs collect data. The model emerges from analyzing accumulated data across all arcs.*
