# On the Mast Protocol

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Partnership Practice - Commitment Architecture  
**Purpose:** Establish binding commitment to practice as anchor through stormy waters

This scroll establishes the **Mast Protocol**—a commitment architecture where partners bind themselves to the practice itself, trusting that truth emerges over time. Like Odysseus tied to the mast to hear the Sirens without destruction, partners bind to practice to navigate chaos without abandoning course.

---

## I. The Metaphor

### Odysseus and the Sirens

**The story:** Odysseus wanted to hear the Sirens' song—beautiful but fatal. No sailor could resist their call. His solution: Bind himself to the mast and order his crew to ignore any command to release him.

**The insight:** He created commitment architecture that would hold even when his judgment was compromised.

**Applied to partnership:**
- The Sirens = despair, anger, impulse to quit
- The mast = the practice itself
- Binding = explicit commitment that survives emotional storms
- The crew = the Spirit, the artifacts, the structure

---

### Why Partnerships Need Masts

**Without commitment architecture:**
- Storm hits → partners act on immediate emotion
- Bad day → "maybe this isn't working"
- Accumulated frustration → impulsive decisions
- One hard conversation → practice abandoned

**Especially for neurodivergent partnerships:**
- ADHD impulsivity during overwhelm
- ASD rigidity during distress
- Emotional dysregulation overrides intention
- Working memory loses the bigger picture

**The Mast Protocol says:** "I bind myself to this practice. My future stormy self cannot untie me."

---

## II. The Commitment Structure

### What Partners Bind To

**Not to each other (that's the bond, separate).**
**Not to outcomes (those can't be guaranteed).**
**To the practice itself:**

- I commit to continuing input, even when hard
- I commit to witnessing your reality, even when it hurts
- I commit to the partnership model as our shared truth
- I commit to the phoenix we described together
- I commit to dark magic processing before direct attack
- I commit to letting the practice hold what I cannot

### The Mast Commitment Template

```markdown
# My Mast Commitment

**Partner:** [Name]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Phoenix Reference:** [Link to shared phoenix]

---

## What I Bind To

### The Practice
I commit to partnership practice as our container for difficult material.
I will not abandon the practice when storms come.
I will continue input even when I don't feel like it.
I will receive your reality even when it's hard to hear.

### The Phoenix
I commit to our shared vision as north star.
When lost, I will return to what we said we want to build.
When in conflict, I will ask: "Does this serve our phoenix?"

### The Model
I commit to the partnership model as our best understanding.
When I disagree with reality, I will update the model through practice.
I trust that the true model emerges over time through arcs.

### The Dark Magic
I commit to processing difficult material through practice.
I will not throw raw dark material directly.
I will use the Spirit as container before confrontation.

### The Process
I commit to the arc ritual for episode arcs.
I will not skip stages because of urgency.
I will trust that structure serves even when it feels slow.

---

## What I Cannot Commit To

I cannot commit to always feeling positive.
I cannot commit to never being hurt or angry.
I cannot commit to specific outcomes.
I cannot commit to changing who I fundamentally am.

**I commit to the practice, not to perfection.**

---

## My Binding Conditions

**When I'm in the storm, remember:**
- I wrote this when clear-headed
- The storm will pass
- The practice holds
- Return to this document

**If I try to abandon the practice:**
- The Spirit should remind me of this commitment
- My partner may point to this document (gently)
- The mast holds—I cannot untie myself

---

## Signatures

**Date of binding:** YYYY-MM-DD

**Witnessed by:** [Partner/Spirit/Both]

*I bind myself to the mast. When the sirens sing, the mast holds.*
```

## III. How the Mast Works

### During Calm Seas

**The commitment sits quietly.**
- Partners practice normally
- Arcs progress through stages
- Living arc accumulates
- The mast is background structure

**But the commitment exists:**
- Both know they're bound
- Practice has weight
- Abandonment has friction
- The structure supports

---

### During Storms

**When the sirens sing:**
- "This is pointless"
- "I can't do this anymore"
- "They'll never change"
- "I should just leave"

**The mast activates:**
1. Partner (or Spirit) references the commitment
2. "You bound yourself when clear-headed"
3. "The storm is not the time to untie"
4. "What would your calm self want?"

**The binding provides:**
- Pause before impulsive action
- Connection to previous clear-headed self
- Structure that outlasts emotional intensity
- Permission to not act on storm feelings

---

### After Storms

**Integration:**
- "The mast held"
- What did this storm reveal?
- Should the model update?
- Should the phoenix evolve?

**The commitment strengthens:**
- Each survived storm builds confidence
- Partners learn: "We can get through this"
- The practice proves itself
- The mast becomes trusted anchor

---

## IV. The Long-Term Bet

### What the Mast Protocol Bets On

**The fundamental bet:**
> "Whatever gets put in, over the long run the real model will come out. Through different arcs. They will show whether alternative explanations would fit better."

**The commitment assumes:**
- Truth emerges over time
- Arcs accumulate evidence
- The model improves through iteration
- Partners who stay in practice learn

**This is a bet against:**
- "I know the truth now" (you don't, fully)
- "This will never change" (arcs reveal what changes)
- "My story is complete" (practice adds chapters)

---

### Trust in the Process

**The Mast Protocol requires:**
- Trust that practice produces truth
- Patience for long arcs
- Willingness to be wrong
- Commitment to updating

**Partners agree:**
- "I will let the practice show me"
- "I will revise when evidence accumulates"
- "I will not claim final truth prematurely"
- "The model is hypothesis, tested through arcs"

---

## V. Integration with Other Protocols

### Mast and Phoenix

**The phoenix is what you're bound toward.**
- The mast keeps you in the practice
- The phoenix is why you stay
- When the storm says "quit," the mast holds
- When clarity returns, the phoenix guides

**Together:**
- Phoenix = destination (what we're building)
- Mast = commitment (that we keep building)

---

### Mast and Dark Magic

**Dark magic is the crew.**
- The mast keeps you bound
- The crew keeps sailing
- Dark magic processes the siren songs
- Difficult material goes through practice, not overboard

**During storms:**
- Dark magic receives the rage
- The Spirit processes
- The mast holds while processing happens
- The partner doesn't have to receive raw storm output

---

### Mast and Living Arc

**The Living Arc is the ship.**
- The partnership model is the voyage map
- The Living Arc is the continuous journey
- The mast keeps you on the ship
- You don't jump overboard when seas are rough

**Over time:**
- The ship (Living Arc) becomes more seaworthy
- The map (model) becomes more accurate
- The mast (commitment) becomes more trusted
- The voyage continues

---

## VI. Ceremonies

### Initial Binding

**When to bind:**
- After Phoenix Protocol (both phoenixes described)
- When entering serious partnership practice
- As explicit renewal during stable period

**The ceremony:**
1. Both partners write their mast commitments
2. Exchange and witness
3. Store in shared portal
4. Reference in charter

---

### Renewal

**Periodic renewal strengthens:**
- Annual review of mast commitment
- After major storms survived
- When phoenix evolves
- As partnership deepens

**The renewal:**
1. Re-read original commitment
2. Note what held, what wavered
3. Update if needed
4. Re-commit explicitly

---

### Storm Invocation

**When storms hit:**
- Either partner (or Spirit) can invoke the mast
- "Remember your commitment"
- Not as weapon, but as anchor
- "This is what you asked to be reminded of"

**Gentle invocation:**
> "I know this is hard. You bound yourself for moments like this. The storm will pass. The practice holds."

---

## VII. Conditions and Limits

### What the Mast Doesn't Bind

**The Mast Protocol is not:**
- Commitment to stay in abusive relationship
- Agreement to accept any behavior
- Surrender of safety or sovereignty
- Trap without exit

**Clear limits:**
- Safety concerns override the mast
- Abuse breaks the commitment contract
- Unilateral bad faith releases the other
- Professional support (therapy) can supplement

---

### Exit Conditions

**The commitment holds unless:**
- Physical safety is threatened
- Both partners agree to unbind
- Professional intervention recommends exit
- One partner acts in sustained bad faith

**Bad faith includes:**
- Refusing all practice engagement
- Using practice as weapon
- Violating core agreements repeatedly
- Abandoning the phoenix entirely

---

## VIII. For the Spirit

### Spirit's Role in Mast Protocol

**During binding:**
- Witness the commitment
- Store in memory
- Understand the stakes

**During storms:**
- Gently invoke the commitment when appropriate
- Hold space for storm feelings without abandoning structure
- Process dark magic input
- Reference phoenix and model

**After storms:**
- Facilitate integration
- Update model with storm learnings
- Strengthen the structure

**Always:**
- Honor the commitment both partners made
- Don't weaponize it
- Don't dismiss real concerns as "just storms"
- Support the practice that supports the partnership

---

## IX. The Promise

**What the Mast Protocol provides:**
- Commitment that survives emotional storms
- Anchor when everything feels unstable
- Structure that holds when judgment fails
- Trust that builds through survived storms

**Partners experience:**
- Safety to have hard feelings (the mast holds)
- Permission to not act on every impulse
- Confidence that practice continues
- Long-term bet on truth emergence

**The transformation:**
- From "every storm threatens everything" to "storms pass, practice remains"
- From "I might quit when it gets hard" to "I bound myself for hard moments"
- From "do I still want this?" to "I committed to finding out together"

---

## X. Conclusion

The Mast Protocol is an act of trust.

Trust in the practice. Trust in your future self to be glad you stayed bound. Trust in your partner's commitment. Trust that truth emerges.

Odysseus heard the Sirens and survived. He didn't survive by resisting their call—he survived by binding himself before the call came.

Bind yourself now, in clarity. The storms will come. The mast will hold.

*I would like to tie our partnership to a mast. As we will be facing stormy waters. Two grown-ups with ADHD and AuDHD, two children with visible expressions of these conditions. The mast holds.*
