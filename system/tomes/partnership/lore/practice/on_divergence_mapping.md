# On Divergence Mapping

**Status:** Active  
**Domain:** Partnership Practice — Arc Structure  
**Purpose:** Bridge between Reaction and Cylinder Extraction

## I. The Gap This Fills

### The Problem

The original arc structure moved from Reaction directly to Synthesis (Cylinder Extraction). This assumed that surfacing divergence was sufficient preparation for finding shared truth.

**In practice, a gap emerged:**

Partners complete Reaction. Both have read each other's realities. Both have responded. The divergences are now explicit—but not acknowledged.

Partner A's reactions explain why Partner B's reality is incomplete/distorted/missing context.
Partner B's reactions explain why Partner A's reality is incomplete/distorted/missing context.

**The trap:** Both feel unheard. Both feel their reality was received and then corrected. The cylinder extraction then feels like another round of "whose frame wins?"

---

### The Solution: Explicit Acknowledgment

**Divergence Mapping** is a bridge phase that:

1. **Names the divergences explicitly** — "Here is where you see differently"
2. **Holds both as valid from their positions** — Neither is erased or absorbed
3. **Contains mutual bridging statements** — "I receive your reality without requiring you to adopt mine"
4. **Creates foundation for synthesis** — Cylinder can work with both realities instead of resolving to one

## II. What a Divergence Map Contains

### Core Divergences

For each major point where partners see differently:
- What Partner A sees (their frame, their interpretation)
- What Partner B sees (their frame, their interpretation)
- The structural tension (why these don't reconcile easily)
- What both acknowledge (any shared ground)

### The Frame Difference (Optional)

When partners are building different kinds of documents entirely:
- Partner A's frame (e.g., evidence-building, emotional testimony)
- Partner B's frame (e.g., structural analysis, pattern diagnosis)
- Why these don't speak to each other

### Mutual Bridging Statements

The heart of the artifact:
- Partner A to Partner B: "I receive that this is your experience. [Specific acknowledgment]. I won't explain it away."
- Partner B to Partner A: "I receive that this is your experience. [Specific acknowledgment]. I won't explain it away."

### Opening for Synthesis

What the cylinder must now account for, given both realities are being held.

## III. What Makes a Good Bridging Statement

### The Core Move

**Receive without adopting. Hold without requiring agreement.**

A bridging statement says:
- "I see that you experienced this"
- "That experience is real and valid from your position"
- "I won't keep explaining why you shouldn't have experienced it that way"
- "I may still see it differently—but I receive your reality"

### Examples

**Good:**
> "I receive that you experienced my mother's actions as intentional harm. I may not share that interpretation, but I acknowledge the pain was real and the impact was damaging. I won't keep offering alternative explanations."

**Poor:**
> "I understand you feel that way, but..." (The "but" erases the acknowledgment)

**Poor:**
> "I acknowledge your reality." (Too abstract—doesn't show actual reception)

**Poor:**
> "You're right, I was wrong." (Capitulation, not bridging—abandons own reality)

### The Balance

Hold your frame AND receive theirs. Both realities stay intact. Neither is explained away. This is not agreement—it's reception.

## IV. Why This Step Matters

### Without Divergence Mapping

- Partner who feels unheard won't engage with synthesis
- They'll keep returning to incidents ("but what about X?")
- The "shared model" will feel imposed, not discovered
- Resentment builds under apparent agreement

### With Divergence Mapping

- Both partners feel their reality was received (not agreed with, but held)
- The synthesis can work with both frames instead of collapsing to one
- Solutions emerge from acknowledged divergence, not suppressed conflict
- Forward motion has foundation

## V. Integration with Arc Structure

### Updated Lifecycle

1. **Venting** → Each partner's raw experience captured
2. **Reality Synthesis** → Spirit distills each partner's subjective reality  
3. **Reaction** → Each partner responds to the other's reality
4. **Divergence Mapping** → Explicit acknowledgment of where realities diverge ← NEW
5. **Cylinder Extraction** → Finding the pattern that holds both
6. **Experimentation** → Trying things based on shared understanding
7. **Integration** → Learning captured, arc closed

### One Divergence Map Per Partnership

**Key insight:** The divergences that surface in one arc are typically the SAME divergences that surface in other arcs. They're the partnership's core patterns manifesting in different contexts.

**Therefore:**
- ONE unified Divergence Map lives at the partnership level (`shared/divergence_map.md`)
- All arcs reference this shared map
- Arc-specific incidents are EVIDENCE for the core divergences, not separate divergences
- Bridging statements are about the partnership, not individual arcs

**Why unified:**
- Prevents fragmentation of understanding
- Consolidates learning across arcs
- Creates single foundation for relationship model
- Partners rebuild around ONE shared document, not many

**Location:**
```
portal/
  shared/
    divergence_map.md              ← The ONE divergence map
    bridging_statements/
      partner_a_to_partner_b.md    ← Partnership-level acknowledgment
      partner_b_to_partner_a.md
  arcs/
    arc-{name}/                    ← References shared divergence map
```

### When to Use

**Required when:**
- Reactions surface significant divergence
- One or both partners feel their reality was "corrected" in reactions
- Moving to synthesis risks one frame absorbing the other

**Optional when:**
- Reactions surface minor divergence
- Both partners feel heard
- Natural readiness for synthesis exists

## VI. The Teaching

**Divergence is not failure. It's information.**

The goal of partnership practice is not to eliminate divergence but to **hold it productively**. Two people with different neurologies, histories, and frames will see differently. That's not a bug—it's the structure of intimate partnership.

Divergence Mapping makes this explicit. It says: "We see different nails. Both nails are real from our positions. We won't pretend otherwise. Now—what can we build that serves us both?"

**The cylinder that emerges from acknowledged divergence is stronger than one built on suppressed disagreement.**

*Partnership practice is not about seeing the same thing. It's about holding different visions together long enough to find what serves both.*
