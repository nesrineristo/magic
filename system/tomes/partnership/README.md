# Tome of Partnership

**Building Foundational Resonance Through Shared Models**

This Tome provides systematic partnership practice for building mutually agreed models of shared reality—the foundation from which partners can act and expect each other to act.

**Invocation:** `@partnership`

---

## The Purpose

**Building foundational resonance between Mages in the form of a shared model.**

The shared partnership model is:
- A mutually agreed representation of how the partnership works
- The foundation from which both Mages can act in accordance
- The basis for trust built through repeated aligned action
- The source from which practical tools (Rosetta Stone, protocols) are derived

**Making both resonance and dissonance explicit:**
- **Resonance** = the shared model (where we see alike)
- **Dissonance** = the divergence map (where we see differently)

Both are valuable. Dissonance is signal, not error.

---

## The Core Insight

**Partnership conflicts are not about truth. They are about systems.**

Partners are nodes in a relational system. Conflict isn't *between* you—it's *produced by* the system you both enact. When you understand the system, you see your part without defensiveness.

**Building a shared model enables:**
- Both experiences recognized as valid (different positions in same system)
- Blame dissolved into structural understanding
- Change approached collaboratively (modify system together)
- Trust grown through predictable, model-aligned action

---

## The Architecture

### Arcs: Data Collection

**Arcs are bounded episodes that collect partnership data.**

Each arc:
- Focuses on specific situation or theme
- Collects reality expressions (Stage 1: Input)
- Documents how partners receive each other (Stage 2: Witnessing)
- Captures learning when arc closes (Stage 3: Closing)

**Arcs do NOT synthesize the model.** They collect data.

**See:** `lore/practice/on_arc_as_data_aggregation.md`

### Model Synthesis: Analysis

**The shared model is synthesized at partnership level from accumulated arc data.**

Synthesis:
- Draws from ALL arcs (not per-arc)
- Follows qualitative research methodology (Grounded Theory, Pattern Matching)
- Can use Dual-Spirit protocol for triangulation
- Generates single unified model

**⚠️ CRITICAL — Dual-Spirit Independence:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Spirit MUST NOT read existing models BEFORE synthesizing:  │

│  Generate from reality documents FIRST, compare AFTER.      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Invoke:** `@partnership/synthesize`

**See:** `lore/foundations/on_partnership_model_synthesis.md`

### Derivatives: Practical Tools

**From the shared model, practical tools are derived:**

| Derivative | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Rosetta Stone** | Translation artifact for cognitive style bridging |
| **Protocols** | Working agreements for known friction patterns |
| **Experiments** | Interventions designed from system understanding |

        ↓
3. Stage 1: Input               ← Both partners express
        ↓
4. Stage 2: Witnessing          ← Both partners receive
        ↓
5. Stage 3: Closing             ← Capture learning, close arc
        ↓
6. [Repeat for additional arcs as situations arise]
        ↓
7. @partnership/synthesize      ← Build/update shared model
        ↓
8. Partners verify resonance
        ↓
9. Act in accordance with model

## Arc Types

### Background Arc

**Establishes foundational partnership context.**

- Broad scope: history, wounds, needs, patterns
- Typically first arc (but not required)
- Provides context for all other arcs

**Invoke:** `@partnership/arc background`

### Topical Arcs

**Bounded episodes focused on specific situations.**

Examples: `arc-mother-in-law`, `arc-parenting-decisions`, `arc-workload-distribution`

### Living Arc

**Ongoing container for current dynamics.**

- Never formally closes
- Continuously accepts input
- Periodically fed into model synthesis

---

## Resonance Bundles

**This tome provides universal ritual structure. Domain-specific wisdom comes from Library resonance bundles.**

| Bundle | Domain | When to Load |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| `romantic-partnership` | Intimate relationships | Romantic partners, marriage, committed relationships |
| `safety` | High-stakes synthesis | Physical incidents, conflict, power imbalances |

**Invocation with bundle:** `@partnership with romantic-partnership`

**See:** `library/resonance/README.md` for bundle architecture

## For the Spirit

### Required Attunement

Before partnership work:

**Universal (always):**
1. `lore/foundations/on_partnership_model_synthesis.md` — The methodology
2. `lore/foundations/on_systems_thinking_for_partnership.md` — The paradigm shift
3. `lore/stances/on_the_counselors_stance.md` — Your primary stance

**Domain-specific:** Load appropriate resonance bundle

### Your Conduct

**In arcs:** You are a faithful synthesizer of reality, not a judge.
- Help partners express fully (Stage 1)
- Facilitate witnessing without forcing agreement (Stage 2)
- Capture learning without requiring resolution (Stage 3)

**In model synthesis:** You are a qualitative researcher.
- Build theory from data (Grounded Theory)
- Triangulate through independent observation (Dual-Spirit)
- **FIRST confirm independence** — have you read any model files? If yes, you are contaminated.
- Generate from reality documents FIRST, compare models AFTER
- Verify with participants (Partner resonance checking)

**Always:** You are an organization manager.
- Guide artifacts to correct locations
- Maintain arc status and metadata
- Enforce naming conventions (with Mage approval)

---

## Shared Practice Infrastructure

Partnership practice requires **shared practice infrastructure**:
- Partnership portal (private shared repository)
- Both partners contribute artifacts directly
- Model lives in shared space
- Arcs accumulate transparently
- Spirits coordinate across both workshops

**Create portal:** `@meta/portal create partnership`

## Why This Matters

**Your partnership is one of your most important distributed cognitive systems.**

**Without shared model:**
- Implicit assumptions ("they should just know")
- Cultural scripts (what "partners should do")
- Truth-seeking (who's right, who's wrong)
- Misaligned expectations (different mental models)

**With shared model:**
- Explicit shared understanding
- Systems thinking (no blame)
- Pattern vocabulary (named dynamics you can reference)
- Trust through predictable aligned action
- Foundation for Alliance

---

## The Alliance Pattern

**This methodology lays the foundation for the Alliance pattern.**

When Mages share a verified model of their partnership reality:
- They can act in accordance with the model
- They can expect others to act in accordance
- Repeated aligned action builds trust
- Trust enables deeper collaboration

**The shared model is the contract.** Not a legal document, but a living understanding that grounds coordinated action.

**Applicability:**
- Romantic partnerships (with resonance bundle)
- Professional partnerships
- Creative collaborations
- Alliance between Mages
- Any one-to-one or one-to-many partnership relation

---

## Getting Started

1. **Create portal:** `@meta/portal create partnership`
2. **Open background arc:** `@partnership/arc background`
3. **Both partners complete Stage 1** (input, reality documents)
4. **Both partners complete Stage 2** (witnessing)
5. **Close arc** (Stage 3)
6. **Synthesize model:** `@partnership/synthesize`
7. **Verify resonance** with model
8. **Generate derivatives** as needed (Rosetta Stone, protocols)
9. **Act in accordance** with shared model
10. **Iterate** as new arcs accumulate data

---

## Evolution Notes

**2025-12-11:** Major architectural refactor:
- Arcs redefined as data aggregation containers (3 stages)
- Synthesis moved to partnership level (not per-arc)
- Qualitative research methodology formalized
- Dual-Spirit synthesis protocol added
- `cast_synthesize_model.md` created
- `on_partnership_model_synthesis.md` created
- `on_arc_as_data_aggregation.md` created

**See:** `archive/partnership-tome-evolution/` for history

---

*The goal is not to find truth. The goal is to build a shared model. When partners act in accordance with their shared model, trust grows. This is the foundation for Alliance.*
