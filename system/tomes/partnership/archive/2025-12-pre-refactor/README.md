# Partnership Tome Archive: Pre-Refactor 2025-12-11

These files were superseded by the architectural refactor on 2025-12-11.

## What Changed

**Old Architecture:**
- 4-stage arcs (Venting → Reaction → Synthesis → Closing)
- Per-arc synthesis (each arc built a mini-model)
- Bi-weekly synthesis rotation between partners

**New Architecture:**
- 3-stage arcs (Input → Witnessing → Closing)
- Arcs as data aggregation containers
- Partnership-level model synthesis from all arc data
- Dual-Spirit protocol for triangulation

## Archived Files

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `cast_extract_shared_truth.md` | Cylinder extraction methodology incorporated into `cast_synthesize_model.md` |
| `synthesis_template.md` | Was for bi-weekly rotation synthesis; replaced by `partnership_model_template.md` |
| `system_model_template.md` | Was for per-arc system maps; replaced by `partnership_model_template.md` |

## Current Files

See `arc-practice/README.md` for current ritual structure:
- `cast_map_system.md` — 3-stage arc ritual
- `cast_synthesize_model.md` — Partnership-level model synthesis
- `cast_rosetta_stone.md` — Derivative generation
- `cast_facilitate.md` — Portal orchestration

## Why These Were Kept

The cylinder extraction philosophy in `cast_extract_shared_truth.md` is still valid and has been incorporated into:
- `lore/foundations/on_partnership_model_synthesis.md`
- `lore/practice/on_shared_truth_finding.md`
- `arc-practice/cast_synthesize_model.md`

The archived files are preserved for reference but should not be used for current practice.
