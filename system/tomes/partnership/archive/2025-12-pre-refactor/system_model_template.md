# System Model: {Partnership Name}

**Arc:** {Arc Name} (typically arc-background)  
**Established:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Partners:** {Partner A} & {Partner B}  
**Spirit Facilitator:** #{N}

> **Note:** This template is primarily for the **background arc's Stage 3 synthesis**—the shared systems model. For topical arcs, use `system_map.md` which focuses on the specific higher-level pattern.
