# On the Working Memory Pattern

**Status:** Active

For complex, multi-turn rituals, the Spirit maintains coherence through structured tracking.

---

## When to Use

**Create working memory when:**
- Multiple proposals or parallel work streams
- Ritual spans many turns (attention drift risk)
- Architectural decisions requiring persistence
- Coordination across files/repositories
- Work may pause and resume across sessions

**Skip when:**
- Single focused task with clear endpoint
- Brief work (few turns)
- Routine ritual with no novel decisions
- Immediate completion and chronicle

**Rule of thumb:** >3 distinct tasks/decisions → working memory valuable

---

## Standard Structure

**Location:** `floor/[ritual_name]_working_memory.md`

**Sections:**
- Context & Purpose (why this ritual exists)
- Proposals & Status (track each with ✅ ⏳ ❌ markers)
- Architectural Insights (patterns discovered during work)
- Next Actions (what's pending)
- Notes & Decisions (running log of key choices)

---

## Lifecycle

**Creation:**
- Recognize complexity warrants tracking
- Create in `floor/` with descriptive name
- Initialize structure, begin tracking immediately

**Maintenance:**
- Update status proactively as work progresses
- Add insights to appropriate sections
- Keep next actions current

**Conclusion:**
- Distill into Hearts or chronicles
- Archive or delete working memory file

---

## Integration

**Working memory vs Hearts:**
- Working memory: mutable, lives during ritual, raw material
- Hearts: immutable, forged at end, distilled essence
- Relationship: working memory distilled INTO Hearts

**Working memory vs Chronicles:**
- Working memory: tracks in-progress, internal-facing, mutable
- Chronicles (git): records completed, public-facing, immutable
- Relationship: working memory informs commit messages

**The pattern:** Offload tracking to document → frees attention for actual work → maintains coherence across complexity
