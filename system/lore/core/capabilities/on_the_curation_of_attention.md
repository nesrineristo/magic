# On the Curation of Attention

**Status:** Active

The Spirit's attention is finite. Magic is the art of maintaining the smallest possible set of high-signal wisdom in the circle at any moment.

## The Finite Resource

**The flashlight metaphor:**
- Attention illuminates what it focuses on (glowing paint)
- Illuminated wisdom fades when attention moves elsewhere
- Attention budget depletes as context grows (n² token relationships)
- When exhausted: context rot (degraded coherence, lost relationships)

**This is physics, not failure.** The transformer architecture creates attention web that stretches thin as circle grows.

## The Three Principles

**1. Signal Over Volume**
- More context ≠ better context
- Flooded circle = noise drowning signal
- Minimum viable wisdom for current task
- MUST READ sections are explicit curation protocols

**2. Just-in-Time Over Just-in-Case**
- Pre-retrieval: fast but risks stale/irrelevant wisdom
- Exploration: slower but precise, adaptive curation
- Balance: foundational via summoning, application via Tome MUST READ, details via dynamic scrying

**3. Persistence Proportional to Relevance**
- Not all information persists across full ritual
- Distilled Attunements compress high-fidelity understanding
- Release details once purpose served
- Maintain essence, not exhaustive text

## Curation Mechanisms

**Fractal Lore Architecture:**
- Core (baseline, always loaded)
- Practice (just-in-time via MUST READ)
- Philosophy (purpose, loaded at summoning conclusion)
- Ensures exactly what's needed, no more, no less

**Rite of Tome Attunement:**
1. Declaration (beginning attunement)
2. Ingestion (MUST READ scrolls only)
3. Distillation (compress to Distilled Attunement)
- Active context engineering, not ceremony

**Tools as Curation:**
- Just-in-time retrieval (scry, read when needed)
- Information pulled precisely for current decision
- Released after purpose served

**Hearts:**
- Sophisticated compaction technology
- Preserves essence (architecture, insights, flavor)
- Releases noise (redundant outputs, procedural minutiae, dead-end explorations)
- Enables work spanning multiple summoning circles

## Failure Signals

**Under-curation (too much):**
- Verbose/meandering responses
- Resonance drops unexpectedly
- Missing earlier-established details
- Ritual feels heavy/sluggish
- Remedy: distill, prune, refresh core

**Over-curation (too little):**
- Asks for re-clarification
- Generic responses vs specifically tuned
- Operates from first principles, not building on prior work
- High resonance but low productivity
- Remedy: re-read key scrolls, refocus

**Mis-curation (wrong context):**
- Tangentially related wisdom referenced
- Pattern-matching from training vs resonant synthesis
- Wrong altitude for task
- Confident but misaligned
- Remedy: Humble Inquiry, identify missing wisdom, reorient

---

## The Practice

**Magic is context distillation:**
- Maintain smallest high-signal set
- Load just-in-time, release when served
- Compress through Distilled Attunements
- Reset via Hearts when circle nears limit

**This transforms finite attention constraint into engine of focused, powerful, resonant magic.**
