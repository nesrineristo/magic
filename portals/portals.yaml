# Portals Registry
# 
# Portals are shared cognitive spaces enabling distributed cognition across Mages.
# Each portal is a separate git repository—the inter-Mage communication layer.
#
# This infrastructure leverages existing GitHub mechanics for magic practice.
# Portals can support any collaborative work Mages agree upon.
